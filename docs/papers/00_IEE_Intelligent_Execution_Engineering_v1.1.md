## Executive Summary

**Intelligent Execution Engineering (IEE)** is the discipline responsible for designing and implementing the **Doing Engine** component of MAD agents. While ICCM handles context, IDE handles decisions, and IAE handles assembly, IEE focuses on the critical "last mile": translating decisions into safe, observable, and effective actions in specific domains.

IEE produces domain-specific **Doing Engines** that consume `Decision Packages` from the Thinking Engine and produce `Execution Outcome Packages`, which provide a rich feedback signal to the agent's State Manager, enabling learning and adaptation.

## 1. Introduction: The Execution Problem

### 1.1 Why Execution Engineering Matters

Execution is not a trivial function call. It requires safety checks, tool orchestration, error recovery, and robust feedback. IEE treats execution as a first-class engineering discipline to prevent brittle, unsafe, and unauditable agent behavior.

### 1.2 The IEE Discipline

**Input:** A `Decision Package` from the DER (IDE), as specified in the IAE Canonical Contracts.
**Process:** Validate, select tools, execute with monitoring, and capture outcomes.
**Output:** An `Execution Outcome Package` sent to the State Manager (IAE), as specified in the IAE Canonical Contracts. This closes the agent's primary operational loop.

### 1.3 The Quaternary Structure (ICCM + IDE + IEE + IAE)

The complete IAE (Intelligent Agentic Engineering) discipline comprises four sub-disciplines:

| Discipline | Repository | Output | Role in MAD |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **ICCM** | ICCM | CET | Context Engineering (Thinking Engine) |
| **IDE** | Joshua | Rules Engine + DER | Decision Engineering (Thinking Engine) |
| **IEE** | Joshua | **Doing Engine** | **Execution Engineering (action execution)** |
| **IAE** | Joshua | Complete agents | Agent Assembly (provides State Manager, integrates all) |

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Execution Engineering Principles

- **Safety First:** Validate all `Decision Package` preconditions and safety assertions before execution.
- **Observable Execution:** Every action must be observable, producing the telemetry captured in the `Execution Outcome Package`.
- **Formal Feedback Loops:** The `Execution Outcome Package` is not just a log; it is a structured report designed to update the agent's World Model and Task Context within the State Manager.
- **Domain Adaptation:** Doing Engines are domain-specific implementations of a common interface.

### 2.2 Relationship to Thinking Engine

The boundary between Thinking and Doing is a formal, bidirectional contract:
- **IDE → IEE:** The `Decision Package` is the command. It specifies the *what*, not the *how*. It contains the `action_name`, `parameters`, and `expected_effects`.
- **IEE → State Manager (IAE):** The `Execution Outcome Package` is the report. It details the execution `status`, `observed_effects`, and any deviations from the expected. This feedback is critical for the DER to learn and for the World Model to remain accurate.

This closed-loop design enables the agent to detect "execution drift"—where the world responds differently than expected—a key signal for replanning or learning.

## 3. Architecture Components (High-Level)

### 3.1 Doing Engine Structure

A generic Doing Engine is composed of four logical stages that process the incoming `Decision Package` and generate the outgoing `Execution Outcome Package`.

## 7. Relationship to ICCM, IDE, and IAE

**IEE's Role in IAE:**

IEE is the **Execution Engineering** discipline, completing the quaternary.

1.  **ICCM** → Understands context.
2.  **IDE** → Makes decisions.
3.  **IEE** → Executes decisions and reports outcomes.
4.  **IAE** → Assembles the agent and manages its state.

**Integration Points:**

-   **IDE → IEE Boundary:** The formal interface is the **`Decision Package`** schema.
-   **IEE → IAE Boundary:** The formal interface is the **`Execution Outcome Package`** schema, which is consumed by the IAE-provided State Manager. This feedback loop is the primary mechanism for agent learning and adaptation.

*(Remaining sections on paper structure, roadmap, etc., are omitted for brevity but would be updated to reflect these foundational changes.)*
