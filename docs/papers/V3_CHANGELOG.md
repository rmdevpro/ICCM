# ICCM v3 Changelog - Complete Update Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** v3 updates complete (some papers have ongoing content reductions noted in changelogs)

---

## Overview

v3 updates incorporate comprehensive feedback from Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI GPT-4.1 reviews, strengthening empirical validation rigor while maintaining feasibility for our 5-person research lab with $7,840 hardware budget.

**Key Verdicts from Reviewers:**
- **50 apps is sufficient** for proof-of-concept (both reviewers agree)
- **Safety mechanisms are adequate** for research lab (both reviewers agree)
- **No unjustified rejections** - all our REJECT decisions validated
- **Credible for top-tier conferences** as proof-of-concept/feasibility study
- **Both reviewers**: "You are ready to proceed."

## Critical Additions from Reviewer Feedback

### 1. Hold-Out Validation Set (MUST ADD - both reviewers)
- **Papers**: 00, 01, 02, 05, 06
- **Change**: 50 apps → 40 training + 10 hold-out (never trained on)
- **Rationale**: Prevents overfitting, provides true generalization measure

### 2. Statistical Rigor (MUST ADD - both reviewers)
- **Papers**: 00, 01, 02, 05, 06
- **Change**: Added H₀/H₁ hypothesis testing, paired t-test, α=0.05, 80% power
- **Rationale**: Establishes scientific rigor for proof-of-concept claims

### 3. RAG Baseline (MUST ADD - both reviewers)
- **Papers**: 00, 01, 02, 06
- **Change**: Added well-implemented RAG baseline with pgvector and competitive parameters
- **Rationale**: Head-to-head comparison against competitive automated approach

### 4. Human Validation Metrics (SHOULD ADD - both reviewers)
- **Papers**: 04A, 06
- **Change**: Percent agreement tracking, disagreement resolution workflow
- **Rationale**: Quantitative validation quality measurement

### 5. Gold Standard Process (SHOULD ADD - Gemini)
- **Papers**: 04A
- **Change**: 2 reviewers + tiebreaker resolution, consensus formation
- **Rationale**: Establishes rigorous upper bound for automated approaches

### 6. Backup Strategy (SHOULD ADD - Gemini)
- **Papers**: 00, 08
- **Change**: Nightly NAS backups, 3-2-1 rule, retention policies
- **Rationale**: Protects critical research data and model checkpoints

### 7. Limitations as Strengths (SHOULD ADD - Gemini)
- **Papers**: 01
- **Change**: "Quality over quantity" framing for 50-app decision
- **Rationale**: Positions scope choices as deliberate design decisions

### 8. Scaling Roadmap (SHOULD ADD - OpenAI)
- **Papers**: 05
- **Change**: Year 1 (50 apps) → Year 2 (500 apps) → Year 3 (3000+ apps)
- **Rationale**: Shows clear path forward if proof-of-concept succeeds

### 9. Future Work Sections (NICE TO HAVE - OpenAI)
- **Papers**: 02, 13, 14
- **Change**: Brief future work notes for synthetic data, production security
- **Rationale**: Acknowledges longer-term considerations

## Empirical Validation Summary (Consistent Across All v3 Papers)

**Dataset:**
- **Total**: 50 carefully selected real-world applications
- **Training Set**: 40 applications (80%)
- **Hold-Out Set**: 10 applications (20%, never used in training)
- **Canary Set**: 10 applications (separate, for catastrophic forgetting detection)

**Three-Baseline Comparison:**
1. **Manual Gold Standard**: Human experts (2 reviewers + tiebreaker) - ~85% target
2. **RAG Baseline**: pgvector + text-embedding-3-large - ~60% expected
3. **No Context Baseline**: Direct LLM without requirements - ~40% expected

**Statistical Methodology:**
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: CET-D ≤ RAG baseline
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: CET-D > RAG baseline
- **Test**: Paired t-test across 40 training applications
- **Significance**: α = 0.05 (95% confidence)
- **Power**: 80% to detect 15% improvement

**Success Criteria:**
- **Primary**: CET-D beats RAG by >15 percentage points (p<0.05)
- **Secondary**: CET-D achieves >75% of gold standard performance
- **Target**: >75% test pass rate on hold-out set

## Design Decisions (Accepted Limitations)

### What We ACCEPTED from Reviews:
✅ Hold-out validation set (10 apps)
✅ Statistical rigor (paired t-test, power analysis)
✅ RAG baseline comparison
✅ Human validation metrics
✅ Catastrophic forgetting prevention (canary set)
✅ Training data quality standards
✅ Safety mechanisms and boundaries
✅ Backup and disaster recovery

### What We REJECTED (With Justification):
❌ 3,000+ apps → **50 apps** (quality over quantity, 100% manual validation)
❌ Enterprise security → **Docker isolation** (appropriate for 5-person research lab)
❌ Complex MLOps → **Simple logs** (right-sized for prototype scale)
❌ Non-software domains → **Software first** (prove core concept, clear metrics)
❌ Formal IRR → **Percent agreement** (appropriate for 5-person lab)
❌ Full federated security → **Basic encryption** (research prototype, not production)

### What We're DEFERRING (Future Work):
⏸️ CET-T (team context) - Prove CET-D first
⏸️ Full self-bootstrapping - Papers 07A/07B now aspirational future work
⏸️ Bidirectional processing - Paper 13 clearly marked as vision
⏸️ 3,000+ app scale - Paper 05 includes scaling roadmap if POC succeeds
