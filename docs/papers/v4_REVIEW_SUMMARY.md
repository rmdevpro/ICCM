## Papers Reviewed and Status

### ‚úÖ Paper 01 (Primary Paper) - CORRECT
- No changes needed
- Correctly describes CET generating/engineering context
- Does not claim CET generates requirements or code

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Paper 02 (Progressive Training) - CORRECTED
**Issues found and fixed:**
- Line 33: Fixed reference to Paper 00 constraints
- Line 155: Fixed "CET generates requirements specification"
- Line 233: Fixed `cet.generate_requirements()` code
- Line 390: Fixed description of Phase 3
- Lines 397-411: Fixed diagram flow
- Line 450: Fixed `cet.extract_requirements()` code
- Line 539: Fixed another extraction instance
- Line 621: Fixed "requirements extraction quality"
- Line 623: Fixed training goal
- Line 674: Fixed "CET assesses extraction quality"
- Line 673: Fixed "Extract Requirements"
- Line 816: Fixed validation protocol
- Line 904: Fixed comparison table
- Line 963: Fixed conclusion

### ‚úÖ Paper 03 (CET Architecture) - CORRECT
- No major issues found
- Uses "extract" correctly (extracting information for context)
- Does not have CET generating outputs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Paper 05 (CET-D Requirements) - PARTIALLY CORRECTED
**Issues fixed:**
- Abstract: Clarified CET enables LLMs to generate
- Line 69: Fixed "generate implementation-ready specifications"
- Line 319: Fixed extraction description
- Section 4 title: Changed to "Context Engineering Strategies"
- Section 5 title: Changed to "Context Engineering for Multi-Standard Requirements"
- Line 58: Fixed section overview
- Line 65: Fixed demonstration description
- Line 867: Fixed conclusion

**Still needs work:**
- Code examples throughout still show CET generating requirements
- Class names like `BehavioralRequirementsExtractor` need renaming
- Methods like `generate_user_story()` need complete revision

### üî¥ Paper 04A (Code Execution Feedback) - NEEDS CORRECTION
- Has instances of CET generating code/requirements

### üî¥ Paper 04B (Production Learning) - NEEDS CORRECTION
- Has instances of CET generating/extracting requirements

### üî¥ Paper 06 (Requirements Validation) - NEEDS CHECKING
- Not yet reviewed

### üî¥ Paper 07A (Self-Bootstrapping) - NEEDS CORRECTION
- Line 303: `self.cet_d.generate_code(context)`
- Line 352: `self.cet_d.generate_code(refinement_context)`
- Multiple references to CET generating code

### üî¥ Paper 07B (Continuous Improvement) - NEEDS CORRECTION
- Has instances of CET generating improvements

### ‚úÖ Papers 08-14 (Infrastructure) - LIKELY CORRECT
- Infrastructure papers unlikely to have architectural drift
- Quick scan shows no major issues

## Summary of Work Needed

### High Priority:
1. **Paper 05**: Complete revision of all code examples
2. **Paper 07A**: Fix all instances of CET generating code
3. **Paper 04A & 04B**: Review and correct generation/extraction issues

### Medium Priority:
4. **Paper 06**: Full review needed
5. **Paper 07B**: Review and correct

### Low Priority:
6. **Papers 08-14**: Quick verification scan

---

## Key Pattern to Fix

**WRONG:**
```python
code = cet.generate_code(context)
requirements = cet.extract_requirements(app)
```

**CORRECT:**
```python
context = cet.transform_context(app)
code = llm.generate_code(context)
requirements = llm.generate_requirements(context)
```

## Files Created So Far

### v4 Papers (Corrected):
- `01_ICCM_Primary_Paper_v4.md` ‚úÖ
- `02_Progressive_Training_Methodology_v4.md` ‚úÖ
- `05_CET_D_Requirements_Engineering_Implementation_v4.md` ‚ö†Ô∏è (needs code fixes)

### Not Yet Created:
- Papers 03, 04A, 04B, 06, 07A, 07B, 08-14 v4 versions

---

## Next Steps

1. Fix Paper 05's code examples comprehensively
2. Create v4 versions of Papers 04A, 04B, 07A, 07B with corrections
3. Review Paper 06 for issues
4. Quick scan of Papers 08-14 to verify no drift

The architecture is now much clearer: CET transforms context, LLMs generate everything.
