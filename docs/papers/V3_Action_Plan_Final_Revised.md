# ICCM V3 Action Plan - Final Revised Version
## Incorporating Gemini 2.5 Pro & OpenAI GPT-4.1 Feedback

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** Approved by both AI reviewers - "Ready to proceed"

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Both Gemini and OpenAI **strongly endorsed** the v3 action plan with minor recommendations. This document incorporates all their feedback while maintaining our 5-person research lab context.

**Key Verdicts:**
- **50 apps is sufficient** for proof-of-concept (both reviewers agree)
- **Safety mechanisms are adequate** for research lab (both reviewers agree)
- **No unjustified rejections** - all our REJECT decisions validated
- **Credible for top-tier conferences** as proof-of-concept/feasibility study

## CRITICAL ADDITIONS FROM REVIEWER FEEDBACK

### 1. HOLD-OUT VALIDATION SET (BOTH REVIEWERS - MUST ADD)
**Original Plan:** 50 apps for training
**Revised Plan:** 40 apps for training + 10 apps hold-out (never trained on)

**Rationale:** Prevents overfitting to training set, provides true generalization measure

### 2. STATISTICAL RIGOR (BOTH REVIEWERS - MUST ADD)
**Add to Papers 01, 02, 05:**
```
Hypothesis: H₀: CET-D test pass rate ≤ RAG baseline
Test: Paired t-test across 40 training apps
Significance: α = 0.05
Power: 80% to detect 15% improvement
```

### 3. RAG BASELINE (BOTH REVIEWERS - MUST ADD)
**Add to Papers 01, 02, 06:**
- Well-implemented RAG system as competitive baseline
- Vector database (pgvector) with app-specific codebase indexing
- Compare CET-D vs. RAG head-to-head
- Don't just report absolute numbers

### 4. HUMAN VALIDATION METRICS (BOTH REVIEWERS - SHOULD ADD)
**Add to Papers 04A, 06:**
- Track percent agreement (not just binary)
- Document disagreement resolution process
- Report improvement over time
- Use disagreements as training signal

### 5. GOLD STANDARD PROCESS (GEMINI - SHOULD ADD)
**Add to Paper 04A:**
1. Two reviewers independently create requirements
2. Compare and identify disagreements
3. Third reviewer resolves conflicts
4. Consensus becomes gold standard

### 6. BACKUP STRATEGY (GEMINI - SHOULD ADD)
**Add to Paper 08:**
- Model checkpoints backed up nightly to offline NAS
- GitHub repository with 3-2-1 backup rule
- Redundant storage for critical data

### 7. LIMITATIONS AS STRENGTHS (GEMINI - SHOULD ADD)
**Add to Paper 01:**
"We deliberately chose 50 high-quality applications over a larger dataset to enable 100% manual validation, rigorous quality control, and deep comparison with gold standards. This 'quality over quantity' approach provides more reliable initial validation."

### 8. SCALING ROADMAP (OPENAI - SHOULD ADD)
**Add to Paper 05:**
- Year 1: 50 apps (manual validation) - POC
- Year 2: 500 apps (semi-automated) - if successful
- Year 3: 3,000+ apps (automated filtering) - if scaled

### 9. FUTURE WORK SECTIONS (OPENAI - NICE TO HAVE)
**Add brief notes to Papers 02, 13, 14:**
- Synthetic data validation plan (when scaling)
- Production security roadmap (if deployed)
- Federated learning security considerations

2. **Hold-out validation set** (10 apps never trained on)
3. **Statistical rigor** (paired t-test, power analysis, p<0.05)
4. **RAG baseline comparison** (competitive automated baseline)
5. **Human validation metrics** (track agreement, document process)
6. **Catastrophic forgetting prevention** (10-app canary set, rotation)
7. **Training data quality** (real apps only, 80%+ coverage, manual review)
8. **Safety mechanisms** (rollback triggers, human checkpoints)

## WHAT WE REJECTED FROM REVIEWS ❌

1. **3,000+ apps** → 50 apps (quality over quantity)
2. **Enterprise security** → Docker isolation (appropriate for lab)
3. **Complex MLOps** → Simple logs (right-sized for prototype)
4. **Non-software domains** → Software first (prove core concept)
5. **Formal IRR statistics** → Percent agreement (appropriate for 5 people)
6. **Full federated security** → Basic encryption (research prototype)

**Reviewer Verdict:** "No unjustified rejections" (Gemini)

## WHAT WE'RE DEFERRING ⏸️

1. **CET-T (team context)** - Prove CET-D first
2. **Full self-bootstrapping** - Downscope to future work
3. **Bidirectional processing** - Vision paper only
4. **3,000+ app scale** - Start with 50, scale if successful
