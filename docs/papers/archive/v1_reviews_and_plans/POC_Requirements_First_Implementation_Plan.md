# Requirements-First POC Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
This document maps how a requirements-first approach (Paper F03) integrates with the original 4-phase progressive training methodology from Paper 00. Rather than changing the fundamental training phases, we use requirements extraction and generation as the **subject domain** for CET-D to master, providing clearer validation metrics than open-ended code generation.

## Integration with 4-Phase Progressive Training

The requirements-first approach doesn't replace the 4-phase training - it defines **what** the CET-D learns within each phase:

- **Phase 1**: Learn software requirements as the subject expertise
- **Phase 2**: Transform messy requirements into structured context
- **Phase 3**: Get feedback from LLMs attempting to implement requirements
- **Phase 4**: Continuously improve requirements engineering in production

## Phase 1: Subject Expertise Acquisition (Requirements Domain)

**Per Paper 00**: "Establishes the CET as a subject expert capable of generating high-quality, factually grounded content"

### Subject: Software Requirements Engineering
The CET-D becomes an expert in requirements extraction and specification, learning:
- How to identify functional requirements from code
- How to extract technical constraints and dependencies
- How to document API contracts and data models
- How to specify test cases and validation criteria

### Training Method: RAG-Grounded with Multi-LLM Supervision
```python
training_loop = {
    "input": "Python application source code",
    "rag_sources": [
        "Requirements engineering textbooks",
        "IEEE requirements standards",
        "Software specifications corpus"
    ],
    "llm_team": ["GPT-4", "Claude", "Gemini"],
    "output": "Structured requirements + conversation histories"
}
```

### Phase 1 Training Data & LLM Configuration
```yaml
training_data:
  - 100 Python applications with human-annotated requirements
  - Requirements engineering documentation (IEEE standards)
  - Software specification examples from open source projects

llm_team_configuration:
  local_models:  # On P40 cluster (96GB VRAM)
    - llama3.1-70b-q4 (48GB, 4-bit quantized)
    - mistral-large-q4 (22.5GB, 4-bit quantized)
    - codellama-7b (14GB on P4)

  together_ai:  # Pay-per-token
    - codellama-70b ($0.90/M tokens)
    - qwen2.5-coder-32b ($0.80/M tokens)
    - deepseek-r1 (superior reasoning)

  validation:  # Quality anchoring
    - claude-3-opus (1% sampling)
```

### Phase 1 Output (feeds Phase 2)
- Conversation histories about requirements extraction
- Examples of good vs poor requirements specifications
- Patterns of requirement identification and documentation

## Phase 2: Context Engineering Skills (Requirements Transformation)

**Per Paper 00**: "Teaches the CET to transform varied input qualities into structured context"

### Context Transformation for Requirements
Using Phase 1's conversation histories, train CET-D to transform:
- **Poor context**: Vague user descriptions → Clear requirements
- **Messy context**: Unstructured feature requests → Organized specifications
- **Incomplete context**: Partial requirements → Complete specifications
- **Excellent context**: Well-structured requirements ready for implementation

### Training Data (from Phase 1 conversations)
```python
transformation_pairs = [
    {
        "poor": "make a calculator app that does math",
        "excellent": """
        Functional Requirements:
        - Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
        - Clear/reset functionality
        - Error handling for division by zero

        Technical Requirements:
        - Python 3.8+
        - CLI interface
        - Input validation
        """
    }
]
```

### Phase 2 Skills Learned
- Identify missing requirements from incomplete descriptions
- Structure requirements into functional/technical/validation categories
- Expand vague requests into detailed specifications
- Maintain consistency across requirement sections

## Phase 3: Interactive Context Optimization (Requirements Feedback)

**Per Paper 00**: "The critical phase where the CET learns through feedback loops with LLM responses"

### The Requirements-Code Feedback Loop
```
User Query → CET-D Engineers Requirements Context → LLM Team Implements Code
                        ↑                                    ↓
                        └─── Learning Signal ←── Code Validation Results
```

### Interactive Training Process
1. **CET-D generates requirements** from a user description
2. **Multi-LLM team attempts implementation** based on those requirements
3. **Code execution provides feedback**:
   - Does it compile? (syntax correctness)
   - Do tests pass? (functional correctness)
   - Does it match original app? (requirements completeness)
4. **CET-D learns** which requirement patterns lead to successful implementations

### Learning Objectives in Phase 3
- **Completeness Detection**: Learn when requirements are missing critical details
- **Ambiguity Recognition**: Identify when requirements are unclear to implementers
- **Implementation Feasibility**: Understand which requirements are practical
- **Test Coverage**: Learn to include testable acceptance criteria
- **Error Pattern Recognition**: Identify requirement patterns that cause implementation failures

### Multi-LLM Team Response Patterns
Different LLMs interpret requirements differently, teaching CET-D robustness:
- GPT-4: May over-engineer from vague requirements
- Claude: May ask for clarification on ambiguities
- Gemini: May make different assumptions about intent

### Validation Through Code Execution (Papers 03, 07, 08 Integration)
```python
feedback_loop = {
    "requirements": "CET-D output",

    "llm_orchestra": {  # Paper 09 diversity
        "code_generators": [
            "llama3.1-70b-q4",  # P40 cluster
            "deepseek-r1",      # Together.AI
            "starcoder2-15b",   # Local rotation
            "codestral",        # Rotation pool
            "qwen2.5-coder-32b" # Together.AI
        ],
        "test_evaluators": [
            "codet5-large",     # Test understanding
            "graphcodebert",    # Structure analysis
            "testing-llama-7b"  # Test generation
        ]
    },

    "execution_environment": {  # Papers 07, 08
        "hardware": "Irina with 2x P4 GPUs",
        "containers": "Docker with network_mode: none",
        "languages": "15+ (Python, JS, Java, Go, Rust, etc)",
        "parallel_capacity": "50-100 concurrent executions"
    },

    "validation_metrics": {
        "compilation": "Syntax correctness",
        "tests": "Functional correctness",
        "coverage": "Requirements completeness",
        "performance": "Within 20% of original"
    },

    "learning_signal": "Which requirement patterns → successful implementations"
}
```

## Phase 4: Continuous Self-Improvement (Production Requirements)

**Per Paper 00**: "During deployment, the CET continuously improves through self-critique and real-world feedback"

### Production Learning Loop
```
Production Query → CET-D Self-Critique → Generate Requirements → Observe Implementation
                           ↑                                            ↓
                           └─────── Update if Wrong ←─── Success/Failure
```

### Self-Improvement Mechanisms
1. **Self-Critique Before Submission**: CET-D predicts if its requirements will work
2. **Outcome Observation**: Monitor if implementations succeed
3. **Error Analysis**: When failures occur, analyze why requirements were insufficient
4. **Incremental Updates**: Refine requirement patterns based on production feedback

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Requirements too ambiguous**: Start with highly structured apps
2. **Validation too strict**: Allow semantic equivalence, not just syntactic
3. **Training instability**: Use curriculum learning, simple→complex

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Complexity**: Start with calculators, end with web apps
- **Multiple Validation Levels**: Syntax, semantics, functionality
- **Checkpointing**: Save model at each successful milestone

## Success Criteria for POC

### Minimum Viable Success (Month 6)
- Extract requirements from 50 simple Python apps
- Reconstruct 25 apps with >80% test pass rate
- Demonstrate clear improvement trajectory
- LLM orchestra providing 10+ diverse perspectives

- Reconstruct 75 apps with >90% test pass rate
- Show Phase 3 feedback improves both extraction and generation
- Generalize to unseen applications with >70% success
- 15+ model diversity through rotation (Paper 09)
- <1% model rotation overhead (Paper 07 optimization)

## How Requirements-First Maps to the 4-Phase Training

This approach perfectly aligns with Paper 00's progressive training methodology:

| Phase | Paper 00 Definition | Requirements-First Implementation |
|-------|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Phase 1** | "Subject expertise acquisition through RAG-grounded training" | CET-D becomes expert in requirements engineering, learning from standards and examples |
| **Phase 2** | "Transform varied input qualities into structured context" | Convert messy user descriptions into well-structured requirements specifications |
| **Phase 3** | "Learn through feedback loops with LLM responses" | LLMs implement code from requirements, execution results provide learning signals |
| **Phase 4** | "Continuous self-improvement during deployment" | Production usage refines requirement patterns based on implementation success |

## Key Advantages of Requirements-First Within 4-Phase Training

1. **Clear Validation in Phase 3**: Code execution provides objective feedback
2. **Better Phase 1 Subject**: Requirements engineering is more structured than general coding
3. **Natural Phase 2 Progression**: Poor→good requirements is clearer than poor→good code
4. **Measurable Phase 4 Improvement**: Implementation success rates are objective metrics
5. **Simpler Initial Implementation**: Extract before generate reduces complexity

## Why This Works Better Than Direct Code Generation

### Direct Code Generation Approach (Original Interpretation)
- Phase 1: Learn to code (massive subject area)
- Phase 2: Transform descriptions to code (huge leap)
- Phase 3: Hard to measure if generated code is "good"
- Phase 4: Subjective improvement metrics

### Requirements-First Approach (This Plan)
- Phase 1: Learn requirements engineering (focused subject)
- Phase 2: Transform descriptions to specs (clear structure)
- Phase 3: Objective validation through compilation/tests
- Phase 4: Clear success metrics from implementation

## Integration with Existing Papers

All papers remain unchanged - we're just choosing requirements as the subject domain:

- **Paper 00**: Provides the 4-phase framework we're following exactly
- **Paper 01**: Details how each phase works (we apply to requirements)
- **Paper 03**: Provides code execution feedback for Phase 3 validation
- **Paper 04**: CET-D architecture handles requirements instead of direct code
- **Paper F03**: Provides the requirements extraction methodology we use

## Next Steps

1. **Approve implementation plan**: Confirm requirements-first approach
2. **Begin data collection**: Start gathering 100 Python applications
3. **Setup infrastructure**: Deploy containers and validation framework
4. **Create annotation guidelines**: Define requirements format standard
5. **Start Month 1**: Begin implementation per timeline

## Conclusion

The requirements-first approach provides a more tractable path to demonstrating CET effectiveness. By starting with extraction rather than generation, we:

- Reduce initial complexity
- Provide clearer success metrics
- Create better training data
- Build confidence incrementally

This approach changes the POC implementation strategy while preserving all existing paper content and theory.
