### Master Document Updates
- **v5**: Updated Paper 07 completion
- **v6**: Updated Paper 08 completion (before split)
- **v7**: Documented 08A/08B split, updated status summary

### Current Status Summary
- **Complete drafts (11 papers)**: 00, 01, 02, 03A, 03B, 04, 05, 06B, 07, 08A, 11, F03
- **Partial drafts (1 paper)**: 06A (sections 1-5 complete)
- **Outlines ready for drafting (5 papers)**: 08B, 09, 10, F01, F02

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Paper 08B
Draft Paper 08B v2 with full prose (1,600-2,000 lines):
1. Read 08B_Security_Hardening_Incident_Response_v2.md (current outline)
2. Expand all sections with comprehensive prose
3. Add detailed code samples for all 47 security incidents
4. Include forensic case studies with timeline reconstructions
5. Complete ML threat detection implementation details
6. Update master document to v8 when complete

### Remaining Papers to Draft
- Paper 09: LLM Orchestra (767 line outline)
- Paper 10: Testing Infrastructure (387 line outline)
- Paper F01: Bidirectional Processing (322 line outline)
- Paper F02: Edge CET-P (407 line outline)

## Key Decisions Made

### Paper 08 Split Rationale
**User approved split to allow deep security dive:**
- 08A focuses on architecture and production deployment (systems venue)
- 08B focuses on security hardening and forensics (security venue)
- Split allows going deep on security without bloating architecture paper
- Target: 08B should be 1,600-2,000 lines with detailed incident analysis

### Versioning Protocol
All papers follow strict versioning:
1. Archive current version before modifications
2. Create new version for changes
3. Update changelog
4. Update master document with proper archiving

## Important Context for Next Session

### Tool Preferences
- **Use native `Edit` tool** for text modifications (shows red/green diffs)
- **Avoid `mcp__desktop-commander__edit_block`** (less visible changes)

### File Locations
- Active papers: `/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/`
- Archives: `/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/archive/v[N]/`
- Master document: `ICCM_Master_Document_v7.md` (latest)

### Paper 08B Outline Structure (818 lines)
Complete outline with:
- Section headers for 11 major sections
- Code examples for attack scenarios
- YAML/Python configurations for security policies
- Placeholder metrics and case study templates
- Ready for prose expansion

## Token Usage Note
Session ended at 131k/200k tokens used - compaction failed due to conversation length. Starting fresh session recommended for Paper 08B drafting.
