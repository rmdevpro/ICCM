## Notable Sections

### Most Detailed Forensic Analysis
**Case Study 2 (SEC-2025-0156)**: Multi-stage privilege escalation chain
- 4 distinct attack stages (setuid, ctypes, capabilities, sudo)
- Millisecond-precision execution timeline
- 4 independent defense layers activated
- Complete code sample showing sophisticated fallback logic
- Attribution: likely human-crafted or sophisticated adversarial LLM
- Intent assessment: DELIBERATE ATTACK (high confidence)

### Strongest Technical Contribution
**Section 3.1 (Seccomp Profile Engineering)**:
