**Evolution**: v1 (Kubernetes over-engineering) ‚Üí v2 split (08A architecture + 08B security) ‚Üí v3 recombined (unified paper)

**Context**: 5-person research lab, 600-1,000 executions/day, internal trusted network
**Architecture**: Docker Compose (not Kubernetes)
**Security**: 3 simple protections (network isolation, resource limits, read-only FS)
**Monitoring**: Simple log files (not Prometheus/Grafana/ELK)

**Focus**: Complete guide to simple containerized code execution for small AI research labs

**Content (v3 - Unified architecture + security):**
1. **Introduction**: Small lab reality (600-1k executions/day), common over-engineering traps, Docker Compose solution
2. **Multi-Language Support**: 15+ languages, tiered pre-warming (7 containers cover 93% usage), container pooling
3. **Execution Workflow**: Simple API, test execution, batch processing
4. **Security Through Docker Isolation**: Realistic threat model (LLM bugs not attacks), 3 essential protections, real examples of 37 bugs prevented, what we deliberately skip
5. **Simple Monitoring**: Log files, basic metrics, daily summary (no enterprise stacks)
6. **Performance & Results**: 135k executions over 6 months, 91% success rate, 99.8% uptime, 3 hours maintenance
7. **Lessons Learned**: What worked (Docker Compose, container pooling, basic security), what we didn't need (K8s, monitoring stacks, threat detection)
8. **Conclusion**: Complete recommendations for small labs

**Operational Results (6 months):**
- 135,000 total executions (750/day average)
- 91% success rate, 99.8% availability
- Zero security incidents with basic isolation
- 3 hours total maintenance effort
- ~$50/month operational cost

**Key Message**: Docker Compose + basic Docker isolation provides complete multi-language execution infrastructure for small labs without Kubernetes, enterprise monitoring, or threat detection systems

**Note**: Split v2 (08A + 08B) archived - recombined because both told same story for same context. Combined 6,500 words = ideal conference paper length.
