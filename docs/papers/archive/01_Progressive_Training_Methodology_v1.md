# Four-Phase Progressive Training for Context Engineering Transformers

## Abstract

We present a detailed methodology for training Context Engineering Transformers (CETs) through four progressive phases that mirror human skill acquisition. Each phase builds upon the previous, creating a comprehensive learning pathway from subject expertise to production-ready context optimization. Using software development as our primary domain, we demonstrate how compilation errors, test results, and performance metrics provide rich training signals. Our approach transforms vague requirements into precise context through systematic skill development, interactive feedback, and continuous refinement.

## 1. Introduction

Context engineering cannot be learned in a single training phase. Like human experts who first master domain knowledge before developing meta-skills, CETs require progressive training that builds capabilities incrementally.

## 2. Phase 1: Subject Expertise Acquisition

### 2.1 Objective
Establish foundational knowledge in the target domain (software development) through exposure to high-quality, validated educational content and real-world code.

### 2.2 RAG-Grounded Training

The CET develops subject expertise through Retrieval-Augmented Generation, where it learns to retrieve and synthesize information from curated knowledge bases. This approach grounds the CET in factual, validated content rather than relying solely on parametric knowledge.

**Key Principle**: The RAG system retrieves relevant information from the knowledge bases below, and the CET learns to generate subject-expert responses supervised by multiple LLMs.

### 2.3 RAG Knowledge Base Sources

Phase 1 training leverages free, open-source datasets that provide diverse, high-quality coding education and real-world examples:

### 2.4 Multi-LLM Supervision

Multiple LLMs supervise the CET's subject expertise development, providing diverse perspectives on correct responses:

**LLM Team Composition** (see Paper 09: LLM Orchestra):
- Premium APIs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini): Quality baseline validation
- Together AI models (Llama 3.1 70B, CodeLlama, Qwen2.5-Coder): Diverse coding perspectives
- Local models (Llama 3.1 8B, CodeLlama 7B): High-volume generation

**Supervision Process:**
1. CET retrieves relevant information from RAG knowledge bases
2. CET generates subject-expert response
3. Multiple LLMs evaluate response quality, correctness, completeness
4. Consensus scoring identifies areas for improvement
5. CET learns from high-agreement correct responses

### 2.5 Data Volume and Diversity

**Estimated Training Data:**
- freeCodeCamp: ~10,000 exercises, 100,000+ learner trajectories

- Future expansion: Domain-specific languages as needed

### 2.6 Training Data Preparation

**Preprocessing Pipeline:**

```python
class Phase1DataPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sources = {
            'freecodecamp': FreeCodeCampLoader(),
            'exercism': ExercismLoader(),
            'github': GitHubRepoLoader(),
            'stackoverflow': StackOverflowLoader(),
            'docs': DocumentationLoader()
        }
        self.rag_db = PostgresWithPgVector()  # See Paper 11

    def prepare_training_data(self):
        """Convert raw sources into RAG-ready format"""
        for source_name, loader in self.sources.items():
            raw_data = loader.fetch()
            processed = self.process_source(raw_data, source_name)
            self.rag_db.index(processed)

    def process_source(self, data, source):
        """Source-specific processing"""
        if source == 'exercism':
            return self.process_exercism(data)
        elif source == 'stackoverflow':
            return self.process_stackoverflow(data)
        # ... etc

    def process_exercism(self, data):
        """Extract: problem, tests, solutions, mentor feedback"""
        return [
            {
                'problem': exercise['description'],
                'test_cases': exercise['tests'],
                'solutions': exercise['solutions'],
                'feedback': exercise['mentor_comments'],
                'language': exercise['track'],
                'difficulty': exercise['difficulty'],
                'embedding': self.embed(exercise['description'])
            }
            for exercise in data
        ]
```

### 2.7 RAG-Grounded Training Loop

```python
def phase1_training_step(cet, rag_db, llm_team):
    """Single training iteration for Phase 1"""

    # Generate coding question (from LLM team or dataset)
    question = sample_coding_question()

    # CET retrieves relevant context from RAG knowledge bases
    retrieved_docs = rag_db.retrieve(
        query=question,
        sources=['exercism', 'stackoverflow', 'docs'],
        top_k=5
    )

    # CET generates subject-expert response
    cet_response = cet.generate(
        query=question,
        retrieved_context=retrieved_docs
    )

    # Multi-LLM team evaluates response
    llm_evaluations = []
    for llm in llm_team:
        evaluation = llm.evaluate(
            question=question,
            response=cet_response,
            retrieved_context=retrieved_docs
        )
        llm_evaluations.append(evaluation)

    # Consensus scoring
    consensus = aggregate_evaluations(llm_evaluations)

    # Update CET based on feedback
    loss = compute_loss(cet_response, consensus)
    cet.update(loss)

    return {
        'question': question,
        'cet_response': cet_response,
        'evaluations': llm_evaluations,
        'consensus_score': consensus.score
    }
```

### 2.8 Phase 1 Success Metrics

**Subject Expertise Indicators:**
- Factual accuracy on coding concepts (verified against documentation)
- Ability to explain language features correctly
- Recognition of common patterns and anti-patterns
- Appropriate use of terminology

**Quality Signals:**
- High consensus among LLM evaluators (>80% agreement)
- Responses that compile/execute correctly
- Solutions that pass test cases
- Adherence to language idioms and best practices

**Output for Phase 2:**
Phase 1 generates conversation histories that become training data for Phase 2's context engineering skills. These conversations demonstrate high-quality, factually grounded responses that Phase 2 will learn to engineer context for.
