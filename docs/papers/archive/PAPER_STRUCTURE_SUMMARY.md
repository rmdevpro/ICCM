## Cross-References Added

The primary paper (00) now includes cross-references to all sub-papers:
- Each major section references relevant detailed papers
- Navigation section at end lists all papers by category
- Future directions section links to papers 06, 11, and 12

## Paper Characteristics

### Word Counts (Approximate)
- Primary Paper: 800 words (condensed overview)
- Sub-papers: 1,000-2,500 words each (shell structure)
- Total Framework: ~20,000 words when fully developed

### Key Themes
1. **Software Focus**: All papers emphasize software development as first domain
2. **Objective Metrics**: Code compilation, testing, deployment as training signals
3. **Practical Implementation**: Real infrastructure, not theoretical
4. **Self-Improvement**: System can enhance itself (Paper 06)
5. **Privacy-Preserving**: Edge deployment option (Paper 12)
6. **Bidirectional Future**: Complete pipeline control planned (Paper 11)

## Session Transition Protocol

For future sessions working on these papers:
1. Read `ICCM_Papers_Outline.md` for context
2. Read `00_ICCM_Primary_Paper.md` for framework overview
3. Read specific sub-paper being worked on
4. Check this summary for paper relationships

## Next Steps

All shell papers are complete and ready for:
1. Detailed content development
2. Code examples and implementation details
3. Experimental results (when available)
4. Literature review and references
5. Peer review and refinement

## Important Notes

- **CET-D is proposed, not implemented** - All metrics are targets
- **Software is first domain** - Not medical/legal as originally considered
- **CETs are context optimizers** - Not full LLMs, they preprocess for LLMs
- **Test infrastructure exists** - User has actual hardware and cloud resources
- **Terminology distinction** - "Domain" only for CET-D, "subject" for general topics
