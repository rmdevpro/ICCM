# Intelligent Context and Conversation Management (ICCM): Learning Context Engineering Through Progressive Training with Interactive Feedback

## Abstract

Current Large Language Model (LLM) architectures treat context as a passive input constraint rather than an active engineering target, leading to suboptimal information selection, relevance filtering, and integration quality. We propose Intelligent Context and Conversation Management (ICCM), which teaches transformers to engineer optimal context through a four-phase progressive training approach. Our Context Engineering Transformer (CET) architecture is designed to undergo distinct training phases: (1) Subject expertise acquisition through RAG-grounded training with multi-LLM supervision, (2) Context engineering training using conversation histories from Phase 1, (3) Interactive context optimization where the CET learns through feedback loops with an LLM team simulating real usage, and (4) Continuous self-improvement during deployment. The critical third phase teaches the CET to evaluate its context engineering effectiveness by observing how LLMs respond to its engineered context, learning from the quality and relevance of responses generated. This creates a feedback loop where the CET generates context, observes LLM responses, evaluates those responses, and refines its context engineering strategies. The multi-LLM team provides diverse response patterns during training, preparing the CET for varied downstream behaviors. We propose CET-D (Domain Context Engineering Transformer) as an initial proof of concept implementation to validate that context engineering can be learned as a specialized capability through progressive training rather than engineered through rules.

## 1. Introduction

The quality of context provided to Large Language Models fundamentally determines their output quality. Yet current systems treat context as given input rather than something to be actively engineered, evaluated, and optimized based on downstream performance.

This paper introduces ICCM, a proposed framework featuring a four-phase progressive training approach designed to teach transformers to become expert context engineers through subject learning, skill development, interactive feedback, and continuous improvement.

### 1.1 The Context Engineering Challenge

Real-world LLM deployments face a critical feedback gap: context quality can only be truly evaluated by observing downstream LLM performance. A context that appears well-structured might produce poor responses, while seemingly messy context might yield excellent results. This necessitates learning through interaction.

**The Missing Feedback Loop**: Current approaches optimize context in isolation without considering how LLMs actually use that context. This is like teaching someone to cook without ever tasting the food.

**Response Quality Signals**: The true measure of context engineering success is the quality, relevance, and accuracy of responses generated from that context.

**Conversational Dynamics**: Context effectiveness often only becomes clear through multi-turn interactions where follow-up responses reveal whether critical information was included.

### 1.2 Four-Phase Progressive Learning

We propose that context engineering capabilities must be developed through progressive phases that build upon each other:

**Phase 1 - Subject Expertise Acquisition**: Establish foundational knowledge
**Phase 2 - Context Engineering Skills**: Learn to transform various inputs into structured context
**Phase 3 - Interactive Context Optimization**: Learn through feedback loops with LLM responses
**Phase 4 - Continuous Self-Improvement**: Refine during deployment based on real usage

The critical innovation is Phase 3, where the CET learns to evaluate its context engineering by observing how LLMs respond to its context, creating a feedback loop that teaches practical effectiveness.

### 1.3 Core Contributions

1. **Four-phase progressive training framework** with interactive feedback loops
2. **Response-based context evaluation methodology** where context quality is measured by downstream performance
3. **Multi-LLM interaction training approach** simulating diverse response patterns
4. **CET specialization architecture** enabling domain, team, and personal variants
5. **Proposed proof of concept design** with CET-D for validating learned context engineering in professional domains
6. **Practical optimization philosophy** grounded in actual usage patterns rather than theoretical metrics

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 The Context-Response Feedback Loop

Context engineering cannot be evaluated in isolation. The quality of engineered context is ultimately determined by the responses it enables. This creates a fundamental learning challenge: the CET must learn to predict how its context engineering will affect downstream LLM behavior.

Consider this feedback loop:

```
User Query → CET Context Engineering → LLM Response → Response Quality
                     ↑                                      ↓
                     └──────── Learning Signal ←───────────┘
```

The CET must learn:

- What context features lead to accurate responses
- How context structure affects response coherence
- Which information enables follow-up queries
- What context patterns cause hallucinations or errors

### 2.2 Interactive Learning Theory

Human experts develop skills through interactive practice with feedback. A medical student doesn't just study anatomy; they practice diagnosis and observe patient outcomes. Similarly, the CET must learn context engineering through observing the consequences of its decisions.

**Action-Outcome Learning**: The CET takes action (engineers context), observes outcome (LLM response), and learns the relationship.

**Diverse Response Patterns**: Different LLMs respond differently to the same context, teaching the CET robust optimization strategies.

**Multi-Turn Dynamics**: Context effectiveness often only becomes apparent through conversational sequences.

### 2.3 Response Quality as Training Signal

Traditional metrics (perplexity, BLEU scores) poorly capture context effectiveness. Instead, Phase 3 uses response quality as the primary training signal:

**Factual Accuracy**: Does the engineered context lead to factually correct responses?
**Relevance**: Do responses address the user's actual query?
**Completeness**: Is sufficient context provided for comprehensive responses?
**Coherence**: Do responses flow naturally from the provided context?
**Follow-up Capability**: Can the LLM handle follow-up questions based on the context?

## 3. Related Work

### 3.1 Interactive Learning Systems

**Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** (Christiano et al., 2017) demonstrated learning from outcome feedback. Phase 3 applies similar principles with LLM responses as feedback.

**Interactive Imitation Learning** (Ross et al., 2011) showed how agents learn through interaction with expert policies. Our LLM team serves as multiple expert policies.

**Active Learning** (Settles, 2009) identifies informative examples through interaction. Phase 3 discovers effective context patterns through LLM interactions.

### 3.2 Multi-Agent Training

**Self-Play** (Silver et al., 2016) demonstrated learning through agent interaction. Phase 3 uses CET-LLM interaction similarly.

**Population-Based Training** (Jaderberg et al., 2017) evolved agents through interaction. Our multi-LLM approach provides population diversity.

**Adversarial Training** (Goodfellow et al., 2014) improved robustness through opposition. The LLM team provides diverse challenges to CET context engineering.

## 4. Four-Phase Training Methodology

### 4.1 Phase 1: Subject Expertise Acquisition

Establishes the CET as a subject expert capable of generating high-quality, factually grounded content relevant to its specialization area.

**Objective**: Build foundational knowledge for evaluating context quality
**Method**: RAG-grounded training with multi-LLM supervision
**Output**: Subject expertise and conversation histories for Phase 2

Note: The specific subject depends on the CET variant being trained:

- CET-P: Personal communication patterns and user-specific subjects
- CET-T: Team collaboration subjects and shared knowledge areas
- CET-D: Professional domain expertise (medical, legal, engineering, etc.)

### 4.2 Phase 2: Context Engineering Skills

Teaches the CET to transform varied input qualities into structured context.

**Objective**: Learn basic context transformation techniques
**Method**: Training on poor-to-excellent context pairs using Phase 1 conversations
**Output**: Initial context engineering capabilities

### 4.3 Phase 3: Interactive Context Optimization

The critical phase where the CET learns through feedback loops with LLM responses.

**Training Loop Architecture**:

```python
def phase3_interactive_training(cet_model, llm_team, training_prompts):
    for prompt in training_prompts:
        # CET generates what it believes is optimal context
        engineered_context = cet_model.engineer_context(
            user_prompt=prompt,
            subject_knowledge=cet_model.subject_expertise,
            conversation_history=available_history
        )

        # Multiple LLMs generate responses from this context
        responses = []
        for llm in llm_team:
            response = llm.generate(engineered_context)
            responses.append({
                'llm': llm.model_id,
                'response': response,
                'quality_metrics': evaluate_response_quality(response, prompt)
            })

        # CET evaluates response quality and patterns
        evaluation = cet_model.evaluate_responses(
            original_prompt=prompt,
            engineered_context=engineered_context,
            llm_responses=responses
        )

        # Learn from the feedback
        cet_model.update_from_feedback(
            context_features=extract_features(engineered_context),
            response_qualities=evaluation.quality_scores,
            failure_patterns=evaluation.identified_issues
        )

        # Generate follow-up interactions
        for response in responses:
            follow_up = generate_follow_up_prompt(response)
            follow_up_context = cet_model.engineer_context(
                user_prompt=follow_up,
                previous_context=engineered_context,
                previous_response=response
            )

            # Evaluate multi-turn effectiveness
            follow_up_response = response['llm'].generate(follow_up_context)
            cet_model.learn_conversational_dynamics(
                initial_context=engineered_context,
                follow_up_context=follow_up_context,
                conversation_quality=evaluate_conversation_flow()
            )

    return cet_model
```

**Key Learning Objectives**:

1. **Response Quality Prediction**: Learn which context features lead to high-quality responses
2. **Failure Pattern Recognition**: Identify context patterns that cause errors or hallucinations
3. **Model-Specific Optimization**: Understand how different LLMs utilize context differently
4. **Information Sufficiency**: Learn when context has too much or too little information
5. **Conversational Coherence**: Ensure context enables natural follow-up interactions

### 4.4 Phase 4: Continuous Self-Improvement

During deployment, the CET continuously improves through self-critique and real-world feedback.

**Objective**: Refine context engineering based on production usage
**Method**: Self-critique and outcome observation
**Output**: Continuously improving context engineering

**Deployment Learning Loop**:

```python
def phase4_continuous_improvement(cet_model, production_interactions):
    for interaction in production_interactions:
        # Generate context
        context = cet_model.engineer_context(interaction.query)

        # Self-critique before sending
        pre_critique = cet_model.evaluate_own_context(context)

        # Observe actual response
        actual_response = production_llm.generate(context)

        # Evaluate outcome
        outcome_quality = evaluate_response(actual_response, interaction)

        # Learn from prediction error
        if abs(pre_critique.predicted_quality - outcome_quality) > threshold:
            cet_model.update_quality_predictor(
                context_features=context,
                predicted=pre_critique.predicted_quality,
                actual=outcome_quality
            )

        # Refine if needed
        if outcome_quality < acceptable_threshold:
            improved_context = cet_model.refine_context(
                original=context,
                response_issues=analyze_response_problems(actual_response)
            )
            cet_model.learn_from_refinement(context, improved_context)
```

            # This will be evaluated by LLM responses externally

    def __init__(self, cet_model, llm_team):

        """Continuous self-improvement"""
        # Online learning from production usage
        # Returns: continuously improving model
```

### 5.3 CET Specialization Architecture

The Context Engineering Transformer is not a monolithic solution but rather a specialized architecture that can be trained for different scopes and purposes. Critically, CETs are specialized context optimizers, not full LLMs, operating as preprocessing layers in a pipeline architecture. Each CET variant is subject-specific, providing a reduced-size model optimized for its particular area of expertise.

#### 5.3.1 Fundamental Architecture

CETs function as context preprocessing layers that optimize information before it reaches a full LLM:

```
User Query → CET → Full LLM → Response
```

This architecture recognizes that context engineering is a distinct capability that can be optimized independently of general language understanding. By separating context optimization from response generation, we achieve both specialization and efficiency. Each CET becomes an expert in its specific subject area while remaining computationally lightweight.

#### 5.3.2 CET Specialization Variants

The CET architecture supports three primary specializations, each optimized for different contexts and deployment scenarios:

**CET-P (Personal Context Engineering Transformer)**

- **Purpose**: Individual user personalization and privacy preservation
- **Subject Areas**: Personal communication patterns, individual preferences, user-specific topics
- **Target Model Size**: ~1-3B parameters (enables edge deployment on personal devices)
- **Training Data**: User's personal communications, documents, preferences (with explicit consent)
- **Deployment**: Local device or private cloud instance
- **Key Features**:
  - Complete data sovereignty - personal data never leaves user control
  - Learns individual communication patterns and preferences
  - Adapts context to user's expertise level and style
  - Filters sensitive information before it reaches cloud services
  - Masters user-specific subjects without broader knowledge overhead

**CET-T (Team Context Engineering Transformer)**

- **Purpose**: Coordinate and optimize shared context across team members
- **Subject Areas**: Team-specific knowledge, collaborative workflows, shared terminology
- **Target Model Size**: ~3-7B parameters
- **Training Data**: Team communications, shared documentation, collaborative patterns
- **Deployment**: Team or organization infrastructure
- **Key Features**:
  - Maintains team-specific terminology and conventions
  - Coordinates context between multiple agents (human or AI)
  - Preserves team boundaries while enabling collaboration
  - Understands role-based information needs
  - Specializes in team's subject areas without general knowledge

**CET-D (Domain Context Engineering Transformer) - Proposed Proof of Concept**

- **Purpose**: Specialized professional domain optimization
- **Domain Focus**: Professional/technical domains requiring deep expertise (medical, legal, engineering, financial, etc.)
- **Target Model Size**: ~3-7B parameters
- **Training Data**: Domain-specific corpora, professional literature, regulatory documents
- **Deployment**: Cloud or on-premises infrastructure
- **Key Features**:
  - Deep domain expertise without general knowledge overhead
  - Translates between general queries and domain-specific context
  - Maintains regulatory compliance and professional standards
  - Masters domain terminology and conventions
  - **Proof of Concept Status**: Proposed as initial validation implementation for the ICCM architecture

#### 5.3.3 Subject-Specific Optimization

The power of CET specialization lies in subject-specific optimization. Rather than attempting to handle all possible topics, each CET variant masters its particular area:

- **CET-P** masters the user's personal subjects of interest
- **CET-T** masters the team's collaborative subject areas
- **CET-D** masters a specific professional domain

This subject-specific approach is designed to enable smaller models that can outperform larger general models within their specialization areas.

#### 5.3.4 Compositional Deployment Patterns

The specialized CET variants can be composed in different configurations based on use case requirements:

**Personal Query Processing**:

```
User → CET-P → LLM → Response
```

Simple pipeline for individual users with privacy preservation.

**Team Collaboration**:

```
User → CET-P → CET-T → LLM → Response
```

Personal context is filtered through team context for collaborative work.

**Professional Domain Work**:

```
User → CET-P → CET-D → LLM → Response
```

Personal preferences combined with domain expertise.

**Complex Enterprise Workflow**:

```
User → CET-P → CET-T → CET-D → LLM → Response
```

Full pipeline leveraging all specialization levels.

#### 5.3.5 Advantages of Subject-Specific Specialization

The subject-specific CET architecture is designed to provide several critical advantages:

1. **Efficient Deployment**: Smaller models (1-7B parameters) compared to full LLMs (70B+) should enable edge deployment and reduce computational costs

2. **Privacy by Design**: CET-P architecture enables running entirely on user devices, ensuring personal data never enters shared infrastructure

3. **Deep Subject Expertise**: Each CET variant can focus on achieving deeper expertise in its subject area without the overhead of maintaining general capabilities

4. **Modular Scaling**: Organizations can deploy only the CET variants they need, scaling incrementally

5. **Clear Boundaries**: Architectural separation enforces privacy, team, and domain boundaries naturally

6. **Reduced Latency**: Smaller, subject-specific models are expected to provide faster context optimization than routing through large general models

This specialization architecture is designed to transform context engineering from a monolithic challenge into a modular solution where each component can be optimized independently for its specific subject area while working together seamlessly.

## 6. Evaluation Framework

### 6.1 Proposed ICCM Evaluation Methodology

We propose evaluating ICCM's context engineering capabilities across all phases using the following framework:

**Context Quality Metrics**:

- Relevance Density: Ratio of relevant to total information
- Integration Coherence: How well multiple sources are combined
- Noise Reduction: Percentage of irrelevant information filtered
- Information Preservation: Critical information retained despite compression
- Structural Clarity: Organization and readability of engineered context

**Performance Metrics**:

- Downstream Task Accuracy: How well LLMs perform with engineered context
- Response Quality: Factual accuracy, relevance, and completeness
- Token Efficiency: Quality per token ratio
- Multi-turn Coherence: Conversation flow quality
- Adaptation Speed: How quickly the system improves

### 6.2 Proposed Baseline Comparisons

```python
def evaluate_iccm_vs_baselines(test_set):
    """Proposed evaluation framework for comparing approaches"""
    approaches = {
        'no_engineering': NoContextEngineering(),
        'rule_based': RuleBasedEngineering(),
        'simple_rag': SimpleRAG(),

            # Evaluate context quality
            results[name]['context_quality'].append(
                evaluate_context_metrics(context)
            )

            results[name]['response_quality'].append(
                average_response_quality(responses)
            )

                quality_per_token(context, responses)
            )

                measure_task_success(responses, test_case.expected)
            )

    return comparative_analysis(results)
```

### 6.3 Expected Phase Contributions

Based on our theoretical framework, we anticipate each training phase will contribute incrementally to overall performance:

| Configuration | Expected Context Quality Improvement | Expected Task Performance Improvement |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Phase 1 only | Baseline | Baseline |
| Phases 1-2 | +60% over baseline | +60% over baseline |
| Phases 1-3 | +100% over baseline | +115% over baseline |
| All Phases | +140% over baseline | +160% over baseline |

*Note: These are theoretical projections based on the progressive training design. Actual results will be determined through implementation and testing.*

## 7. Expected Outcomes and Target Metrics

### 7.1 Anticipated ICCM Performance Improvements

Based on our architectural design and training methodology, we target the following performance improvements over current approaches:

**Target Context Engineering Improvements**:

- >70% reduction in irrelevant information through learned filtering

*These targets are based on theoretical analysis of the architecture's capabilities and will be validated through implementation.*

### 7.2 CET-D Proof of Concept: Design Goals

Our proposed proof of concept implementation for CET-D targets the following capabilities for domain-specific context engineering in professional fields:

**Domain Specialization Goals**:

- Target >90% accuracy in domain term identification

- Target >90% reduction in memory requirements
- Enable on-premises deployment for sensitive domains

*These are design goals for the proposed CET-D implementation. Actual performance will be measured once the system is built and tested.*

### 7.3 Future Directions: Bidirectional CET Processing

While our proposed proof of concept implements unidirectional context engineering (preprocessing only), the CET architecture is designed to naturally extend to support bidirectional processing in future implementations.

#### 7.3.1 Conceptual Framework for Bidirectional Processing

The bidirectional architecture would enable both context optimization and response adaptation:

```
Forward Pass (Context Engineering):
User Query → CET-P → CET-D → LLM

Reverse Pass (Response Adaptation):
LLM → CET-D → CET-P → User Response
```

#### 7.3.2 Potential Benefits of Bidirectional Processing

**Response Personalization**: CET-P could adapt LLM outputs to match user's preferred communication style, technical level, and verbosity preferences.

**Domain Compliance Verification**: CET-D could ensure responses meet domain-specific requirements, regulatory standards, and professional conventions in the reverse pass.

**Team Communication Standardization**: CET-T could format responses according to team protocols and ensure consistent terminology usage.

**Quality Assurance Layer**: The reverse pass could catch and correct potential errors, hallucinations, or inappropriate content before reaching the user.

#### 7.3.3 Research Questions for Bidirectional Implementation

Several open questions remain for bidirectional CET processing:

1. **Architectural Design**: Should the same CET model handle both directions, or would separate forward and reverse models be more effective?

2. **Training Methodology**: How would the four-phase training approach adapt to include bidirectional learning objectives?

3. **Computational Trade-offs**: What is the latency impact of bidirectional processing, and how can it be optimized?

4. **Information Preservation**: How do we ensure critical information isn't lost during bidirectional transformation?

5. **Error Propagation**: How do we prevent errors from compounding through multiple transformation layers?

#### 7.3.4 Implementation Pathway

The evolution from unidirectional to bidirectional CET processing would follow a staged approach:

1. **Current Stage**: Design and validate unidirectional context engineering with CET-D proof of concept for professional domains
2. **Next Stage**: Implement basic response filtering in reverse pass
3. **Advanced Stage**: Full bidirectional transformation with learned adaptation
4. **Future Vision**: Dynamic bidirectional routing based on content requirements

This bidirectional capability represents an exciting future direction that builds upon the foundation to be established by our proposed unidirectional proof of concept.

### 7.4 Training Data Generation Strategy

The multi-LLM team approach is designed to generate diverse training scenarios across all phases:

```python
def generate_training_data(phase, subject, llm_team):
    """Proposed training data generation strategy"""
    if phase == 1:
        # Subject expertise training data
        return generate_subject_conversations(subject, llm_team)

    elif phase == 2:
        # Context transformation pairs
        return generate_context_pairs(phase1_conversations, llm_team)

    elif phase == 3:
        # Interactive scenarios with feedback
        return generate_interactive_scenarios(subject, llm_team)

    elif phase == 4:
        # Production-like interactions
        return simulate_deployment_scenarios(subject, llm_team)
```

### 7.5 Expected Ablation Study Results

Based on our architectural design, we anticipate the following contributions from each component:

1. **Subject Expertise Impact**: Without Phase 1, we expect context to lack factual grounding
2. **Context Skills Impact**: Without Phase 2, we anticipate only basic transformations possible
3. **Interactive Feedback Impact**: Without Phase 3, we expect context to optimize for structure not effectiveness
4. **Continuous Learning Impact**: Without Phase 4, we anticipate performance degradation over time

*These expectations will be validated through systematic ablation studies once the system is implemented.*

## 8. Discussion

### 8.1 Why Progressive Training Should Work

The four-phase approach mirrors human skill development:

- **Foundation First**: Subject knowledge provides the basis for quality assessment
- **Skill Building**: Context engineering techniques build on subject understanding
- **Practical Refinement**: Interactive feedback grounds skills in real usage
- **Continuous Growth**: Self-improvement maintains and enhances capabilities

### 8.2 Key Architectural Insights

**Context Quality vs. Effectiveness**: Well-structured context doesn't always produce good responses; Phase 3's feedback loop is designed to teach practical effectiveness.

**Subject-Specific Specialization**: Smaller, subject-focused CETs are expected to outperform general models for context engineering while enabling privacy-preserving deployment patterns.

**Multi-LLM Benefits**: Different models' perspectives during training should create robust context engineering strategies.

**Conversation History Value**: Phase 1's byproduct becomes Phase 2's training data, creating natural progression.

**Self-Improvement Necessity**: Phase 4 is designed to prevent performance degradation and enable adaptation to new patterns.

### 8.3 Computational Considerations

**Estimated Training Costs**:

- Phase 1: Standard supervised learning costs
- Phase 2: Minimal additional cost using existing data
- Phase 3: Higher cost due to multiple LLM inference (estimated 3-4x Phase 1)
- Phase 4: Ongoing but minimal per-interaction cost

**Expected Deployment Efficiency**:

- CET-D (target 5B parameters) vs Full LLM (70B+ parameters)
- Target >10x reduction in inference cost for context processing
- Should enable edge deployment for CET-P variants
- Modular scaling based on organizational needs

**Projected ROI**: Initial training investment is expected to pay off through:

- Reduced production inference costs (fewer tokens, smaller models)
- Improved task success rates (fewer retries)
- Better user satisfaction (less clarification needed)
- Privacy preservation (no cloud data exposure with CET-P)

### 8.4 Implementation Challenges

Several challenges must be addressed for successful implementation:

1. **Training Data Quality**: Generating high-quality synthetic conversations for Phase 1
2. **Feedback Signal Design**: Defining precise response quality metrics for Phase 3
3. **Model Size Optimization**: Achieving target performance with 5B parameter models
4. **Latency Requirements**: Meeting real-time performance expectations
5. **Privacy Guarantees**: Ensuring CET-P truly preserves user privacy

## 9. Conclusion

ICCM presents a comprehensive framework for learning context engineering through progressive training with interactive feedback. The proposed four-phase approach is designed to create Context Engineering Transformers that learn not just how to structure context, but how to engineer context that produces high-quality responses in practice.

By introducing specialized CET variants (Personal, Team, and Domain), we propose a modular architecture that could balance effectiveness, efficiency, and privacy. Our proposed proof of concept with CET-D aims to demonstrate that context engineering can be successfully learned as a specialized capability for professional domains.

The key innovation is recognizing that context engineering requires multiple types of learning: subject expertise (Phase 1), transformation skills (Phase 2), practical effectiveness (Phase 3), and continuous adaptation (Phase 4). Each phase builds on the previous, creating a comprehensive system designed to bridge the gap between messy real-world inputs and the high-quality context required for optimal LLM performance.

By treating CETs as specialized, subject-specific preprocessors rather than full LLMs, we aim to achieve:

- **Efficiency**: Smaller models that can run on edge devices
- **Privacy**: Personal data never leaves user control with CET-P
- **Specialization**: Deep subject expertise without general knowledge overhead
- **Modularity**: Deploy only what you need, scale incrementally

The distinction between subject-specific optimization (all CETs) and domain-specific expertise (CET-D) clarifies that each CET variant should master its particular area of specialization. CET-P would master personal subjects, CET-T would master team subjects, and CET-D would master professional domains.

This paper presents a theoretical framework and architectural design for ICCM. The next critical step is implementing the proposed CET-D proof of concept to validate these concepts and measure actual performance against our target metrics. Only through implementation and testing can we determine if context engineering can truly be learned as effectively as we hypothesize.

ICCM represents a proposed paradigm shift in how we approach the context challenge in conversational AI systems. Rather than treating context as a constraint to work around, we propose it can be actively engineered through learned, subject-specific specialization, potentially creating more effective, efficient, and privacy-preserving AI deployments.
