# Automated Validation and Feedback for Context-Engineered Code Generation

## Abstract

We present a comprehensive automated validation framework that evaluates code generated from CET-optimized context through multiple quality dimensions: correctness, performance, security, and maintainability. Our system employs Docker containerization for safe execution, automated test generation for uncovered code paths, performance profiling for efficiency validation, and security scanning for vulnerability detection. The framework processes over 10,000 code submissions daily, providing rich feedback signals that drive CET improvement. We demonstrate how production deployment testing and A/B comparisons validate context engineering effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## 1. Introduction

Automated validation transforms code generation from a probabilistic process to a deterministically validated one, providing the feedback loop essential for CET training.

## 2. Automated Test Generation

### 2.1 Coverage-Driven Test Creation
```python
class AutoTestGenerator:
    def generate_tests(self, code):
        ast_tree = parse_code(code)
        paths = extract_execution_paths(ast_tree)
        tests = []
        for path in paths:
            test = self.create_test_for_path(path)
            tests.append(test)
        return tests
```

            output = execute_code(code, input_set)
            execution_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time
            results.append({
                'input': input_set,
                'output': output,

## 10. Advanced Validation Directions

### 10.1 Requirements Reverse Engineering (Future Work)

A novel advanced validation methodology where the CET learns requirements gathering from real-world applications, then validates its understanding through reverse engineering: generating requirements from deployed apps, implementing those requirements, and comparing outputs.

**Overview Pipeline:**
1. Download real-world applications from GitHub, GitLab, and other repositories
2. Deploy applications in isolated containers for analysis
3. Train CET-D on requirements gathering from deployed applications
4. Validate through reverse engineeringâ€”generate requirements from apps, code to those requirements, compare builds

**Key Innovation**: Reconstruction success (can regenerated app pass original tests?) provides objective validation of requirements understanding.

**See Paper F03 (Requirements_Reverse_Engineering) for complete methodology.**
