## Archive and Versioning Protocol

### Archive Structure

```
/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/archive/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ v1/          # Initial complete drafts (archived 2025-09-30)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ v2/          # First revision set
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ v3/          # Second revision set
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...          # Future versions
```

### Versioning Protocol (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: Never modify a published version directly. Always archive then create new version.**

**Before ANY modifications to a paper:**

1. **Archive current version**:
   ```bash
   cp paper_name_vN.md archive/vN/
   ```

2. **Create next version**:
   ```bash
   cp paper_name_vN.md paper_name_vN+1.md
   # Make changes to vN+1
   ```

3. **Update cross-references**:
   - Cross-references remain version-independent
   - References point to current version automatically
   - Example: "See Paper 05" (not "See Paper 05_v2")

4. **Document changes**:
   - Add changelog section at top of new version
   - Note what changed from previous version
   - Date and reason for version bump

**Version Archive Location**: `/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/archive/vN/`

**Active Papers Location**: `/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/` (current versions only)

### Current Status (2025-09-30)
