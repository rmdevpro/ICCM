       374    
       375    The power of CET specialization lies in subject-specific optimization. Rather than attempting to handle all possible topics, each CET variant masters its particular 
             area:

● Now let me also update the order in the subject-specific optimization section:

       391    The power of CET specialization lies in subject-specific optimization. Rather than attempting to handle all possible topics, each CET variant masters its particular 
             area:
       392    
       393 +  - **CET-D** masters a specific professional domain (software development in our proof of concept)
       394    - **CET-P** masters the user's personal subjects of interest
       395    - **CET-T** masters the team's collaborative subject areas
       396 -  - **CET-D** masters a specific professional domain
       396    
       397    This subject-specific approach is designed to enable smaller models that can outperform larger general models within their specialization areas.
       398    

● Now let me also check if there are any other places where the ordering should be updated:

● Search(pattern: "CET-P.*CET-T.*CET-D", path: "/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/00_ICCM_Primary_Paper.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Let me update the compositional workflow ordering and the conclusion:

● Update(/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/00_ICCM_Primary_Paper.md)
  ⎿  Updated ../../mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/00_ICCM_Primary_Paper.md with 1 addition and 1 removal

       758    
       759    This paper presents a theoretical framework and architectural design for ICCM. The next critical step is implementing the proposed CET-D proof of concept to validate 
             these concepts and measure actual performance against our target metrics. Only through implementation and testing can we determine if context engineering can truly be 
             learned as effectively as we hypothesize.
       760    

● ✅ Complete!

  I've reordered all references to put CET-D first throughout the paper since it's the proof of concept we're proposing to build. The changes include:

  1. Section 4.1: Listed CET-D first when explaining subject expertise variants
  2. Section 5.3.2: Moved entire CET-D description to the top of the specialization variants
  3. Section 5.3.3: Put CET-D first in subject-specific optimization
  4. Compositional workflows: Added note that our POC focuses on CET-D
  5. Conclusion: Reordered to list CET-D first

  This properly emphasizes that CET-D for software development is the concrete proof of concept, with CET-P and CET-T as future extensions of the architecture. The paper now consistently
   presents CET-D as the primary focus while maintaining the vision of the complete CET ecosystem.

> Also, I don't think the Python code is appropriate in the top paper.  We should remove it in favor of textual description where reqyuired.

       28    

● ✅ Complete!

  I've successfully removed all Python code from the primary paper and replaced it with clear textual descriptions. The changes include:

  Removed Code Sections:

  1. Phase 3 Training Loop - Replaced with description of the feedback loop process
  2. Phase 4 Deployment Loop - Replaced with description of continuous improvement cycle
  3. CET Architecture Classes - Replaced with architectural component descriptions
  4. Training Infrastructure Classes - Replaced with pipeline orchestration description
  5. Evaluation Framework Code - Replaced with comparison methodology description
  6. Training Data Generation - Replaced with phase-by-phase data strategy description

  Benefits of This Change:

  - More appropriate for academic conference submission
  - Focuses on concepts rather than implementation
  - Implementation details can go in sub-papers (especially Papers 01, 03, and 04)
  - Cleaner, more readable theoretical presentation
  - Maintains all the important concepts without getting bogged down in syntax

  The primary paper now presents ICCM as a pure theoretical framework with CET-D for software development as the proposed proof of concept, while specific implementation details are
  referenced to the appropriate sub-papers.

> section 5.3.3 Subject-Specific Optimization seems out of order versus its preceding items 

● You're right! Section 5.3.3 "Subject-Specific Optimization" is a general concept that should come before the specific deployment patterns in 5.3.4. It's more logical to explain the
  optimization philosophy before showing how the variants can be composed. Let me reorder these sections:

● Read(/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/00_ICCM_Primary_Paper.md)
  ⎿  Read 40 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I see the issue. The sections should actually be reordered so that the general concept (Subject-Specific Optimization) comes before the specific variants (5.3.2). Let me check the full
   structure:

● Search(pattern: "#### 5\.3\.\d", path: "/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/00_ICCM_Primary_Paper.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 5 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● The current order is:
  1. Fundamental Architecture (general concept)
  2. CET Specialization Variants (specific implementations)
  3. Subject-Specific Optimization (general philosophy)
  4. Compositional Deployment Patterns (how to combine)
  5. Advantages

  You're right - "Subject-Specific Optimization" (the philosophy) should come before "CET Specialization Variants" (the specific implementations). Let me reorder:
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> or perhaps it is redundant? what do you think? 

● You're absolutely right - it IS redundant! Section 5.3.3 "Subject-Specific Optimization" is really just restating what's already explained in the CET variant descriptions (5.3.2). Each
   variant already clearly describes its subject-specific focus:

  - CET-D: "Deep software development expertise without general knowledge overhead"
  - CET-P: "Masters user-specific subjects without broader knowledge overhead"
  - CET-T: "Specializes in team's subject areas without general knowledge"

  The whole concept of subject-specific optimization is already woven throughout the architecture explanation. Let me remove the redundant section:

● Update(/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/00_ICCM_Primary_Paper.md)
  ⎿  Updated ../../mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/00_ICCM_Primary_Paper.md with 1 addition and 11 removals                                                                          
       242      - Understands role-based information needs

       245 +  #### 5.3.3 Compositional Deployment Patterns
       246    
       247 -  The power of CET specialization lies in subject-specific optimization. Rather than attempting to handle all possible topics, each CET variant masters its particular 
           - area:

       250 -  - **CET-P** masters the user's personal subjects of interest
       251 -  - **CET-T** masters the team's collaborative subject areas

       281 -  #### 5.3.5 Advantages of Subject-Specific Specialization
       281 +  #### 5.3.4 Advantages of Subject-Specific Specialization
       282    
       283    The subject-specific CET architecture is designed to provide several critical advantages:
       284    

● Now let me also update the conclusion paragraph that referenced this redundant concept:

● Update(/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/00_ICCM_Primary_Paper.md)
  ⎿  Updated ../../mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/00_ICCM_Primary_Paper.md with 1 addition and 1 removal                                                                                
       549    - **Specialization**: Deep subject expertise without general knowledge overhead
       550    - **Modularity**: Deploy only what you need, scale incrementally
       551    
       552 -  The distinction between subject-specific optimization (all CETs) and domain-specific expertise (CET-D) clarifies that each CET variant should master its particular area 
           - of specialization. CET-D would master professional domains (software development in our proof of concept), CET-P would master personal subjects, and CET-T would master 
           - team subjects.
       552 +  Each CET variant masters its particular area of specialization: CET-D masters professional domains (software development in our proof of concept), CET-P masters personal
           +  subjects, and CET-T masters team subjects. This focused approach enables smaller, more efficient models that can outperform larger general-purpose systems within their 
           + specialization areas.
       553    
       554    This paper presents a theoretical framework and architectural design for ICCM. The next critical step is implementing the proposed CET-D proof of concept to validate 
             these concepts and measure actual performance against our target metrics. Only through implementation and testing can we determine if context engineering can truly be 
             learned as effectively as we hypothesize.
       555    

● ✅ Much cleaner!

  Good catch! I removed the redundant section 5.3.3 "Subject-Specific Optimization" since that concept was already thoroughly covered in:
  - The description of each CET variant (they all mention subject-specific mastery)
  - The fundamental architecture section (explaining specialization)
  - The advantages section (which discusses the benefits)

  The paper now flows more logically:
  1. 5.3.1 Fundamental Architecture - explains the pipeline concept
  2. 5.3.2 CET Specialization Variants - describes the three types (D, P, T)
  3. 5.3.3 Compositional Deployment Patterns - shows how to combine them
  4. 5.3.4 Advantages - summarizes the benefits

  This eliminates redundancy while maintaining all the important concepts. The conclusion was also updated to be more concise without the artificial distinction between
  "subject-specific" and "domain-specific" that was confusing.
