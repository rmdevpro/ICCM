# Fiedler MCP Server - Round 2: Cross-Review and Final Implementation

## Task

You have completed your Round 1 implementation of Fiedler. You are now receiving:
1. **Your Round 1 implementation**
2. **Gemini 2.5 Pro's implementation**
3. **GPT-5's implementation**
4. **Grok 4's implementation**

## Round 2 Objectives

1. **Review all three implementations** - Identify strengths and weaknesses of each approach
2. **Learn from the best ideas** - What did others do better than your approach?
3. **Submit your final best version** - Incorporate the best ideas from all three

## Evaluation Criteria

Compare implementations on:

### Code Quality
- Which has the cleanest architecture?
- Which is most maintainable?
- Which has the best error handling?
- Which has the best documentation?

### Correctness
- Which fully implements all 5 MCP tools correctly?
- Which handles edge cases best?
- Which has the most robust provider abstraction?

### Performance
- Which has the most efficient parallel execution?
- Which handles large documents best?
- Which has better logging/observability?

### Extensibility
- Which makes it easiest to add new providers?
- Which has the best configuration management?
- Which is most flexible for future enhancements?

## Your Deliverable

**Final Implementation** incorporating:
- Best architectural decisions from all three
- Best code patterns and practices
- Fixes for any issues found in Round 1
- Any improvements or optimizations identified

**Include:**
1. Complete source code (all files)
2. README.md with setup and usage
3. Brief summary (1 paragraph) of what you changed from Round 1 and why

## Specific Questions to Consider

1. **Provider Architecture:** Which implementation has the cleanest provider abstraction?
2. **State Management:** Which approach to config persistence is best?
3. **Error Handling:** Which has the most comprehensive error handling?
4. **MCP Integration:** Which MCP server implementation is cleanest?
5. **Tool Design:** Which tool implementations are most elegant?
6. **Logging:** Which logging approach is most useful?
7. **Testing:** Which has the best test coverage/approach?

## Guidelines

- **Be objective:** Acknowledge when others did something better
- **Be specific:** Point to exact code patterns or decisions
- **Be practical:** Focus on what actually works, not theoretical perfection
- **Be complete:** Deliver a fully working final version

## Success Criteria

Your final implementation will be evaluated on:
1. Does it incorporate the best ideas from all three?
2. Is it fully working and tested?
3. Is it production-ready?
4. Is it well-documented?
5. Does it improve on Round 1?
