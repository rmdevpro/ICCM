## Scope Validation Summary

### Overall Assessment
REVISIONS NEEDED

### IN SCOPE Review
- CET-D Training Pipeline: Correct
- LLM Orchestra: Correct
- Requirements Engineering Domain: Correct
- Test Lab Infrastructure: Correct
- Conversation Storage & Retrieval: Correct
- Model Management: Correct

### OUT OF SCOPE Review
- CET-P (Personal Context Engineering): Justified
- CET-T (Team Context Engineering): Justified
- Bidirectional Processing: Justified
- Production Deployment: Justified
- Large-Scale Training: Justified

### Missing Critical Components
1. RAG system for Phase 1 subject expertise and Dataset preparation tools: Paper 01 emphasizes RAG-grounded training in Phase 1, and Paper 05 details RAG knowledge base sources and preprocessing pipeline, which are essential for CET-D proof-of-concept but not explicitly listed in IN SCOPE.

### Feasibility Concerns
- Infrastructure: assessment
- Team size: assessment
- Dataset size: assessment
- Timeline: assessment

### Recommended Changes
1. Add RAG system and dataset preparation tools to IN SCOPE Core System Components with citation from Paper 01 Section 4.1 and Paper 05 Section 2.3.
2. Update Feasibility Assessment to confirm 50-app dataset is sufficient per Paper 01 Section 6.4.

### Paper Alignment Issues
- No major contradictions, but scope.md defers Phase 4 as production feature while Paper 01 Section 4.4 describes it as essential for continuous self-improvement.
