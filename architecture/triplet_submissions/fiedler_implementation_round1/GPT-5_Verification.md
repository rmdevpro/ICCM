1) Overall Assessment

The implementation covers the requested surface area: five MCP tools, a multi-provider abstraction, parallel execution, and persistent state. The overall structure is reasonable, with clear separation between tools, providers, utilities, and server entrypoint. However, there are several critical issues that will prevent the server and tests from running successfully out of the box: incorrect config path resolution throughout the code, an async console entrypoint that won’t run, a parameter bug in the OpenAI provider, a metadata mismatch between compile_package and fiedler_send, missing alias resolution in fiedler_send, and mismatches between the config and tests. The MCP integration is close, but the blocking tool execution should be offloaded to threads.

With the corrections below, the implementation will be robust and aligned with the requirements.

2) Strengths

- Clear provider abstraction with retry and exponential backoff.
- Thread-safe logging with correlation IDs and optional log file.
- Sensible orchestration for parallel execution per model.
- Persistent state implemented and simple to use.
- Reasonable MCP server structure, tool definitions, and JSON-encoded text responses.
- Tests cover models, alias resolution, token estimation, state, and configuration shape.

3) Issues Found

Critical
- Wrong config/models.yaml path in multiple modules:
  - fiedler/tools/models.py, fiedler/tools/config.py, fiedler/utils/state.py, fiedler/tools/send.py all point to fiedler/config/models.yaml, but config is a top-level folder. This breaks most functionality and tests.
- Console script entrypoint is async:
  - pyproject.toml maps fiedler = "fiedler.server:main", but main is async def. The console entrypoint will call a coroutine without awaiting it.
- OpenAI provider uses an invalid parameter:
  - max_completion_tokens is not valid for chat.completions; it should be max_tokens.
- Package metadata mismatch:
  - compile_package returns {"num_files", "bytes"} but fiedler_send expects "total_size" and "total_lines" keys, causing a KeyError at runtime.
- Missing alias resolution in fiedler_send:
  - If a caller passes models by aliases (as allowed by the tool schema), create_provider won’t find them, causing failures.
- MCP call_tool blocks the event loop for fiedler_send:
  - fiedler_send performs blocking work; it should be offloaded to a background thread (e.g., asyncio.to_thread).
- config/models.yaml missing required "capabilities" per tests.
- Tests expect token budget warning to include "WARNING" but check_token_budget returns a warning without that string.

Major
- Hard-coded subprocess paths:
  - GeminiProvider and XAIProvider use hard-coded Python/paths to wrappers, which harms portability and deployment.
- Potential zero-thread executor:
  - ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=len(models)) will fail if models resolves to an empty list (e.g., user passes []). Needs validation.
- Unused lock parameter in send_to_model; logger is already thread-safe.
- README and configuration drift:
  - Listed models and token limits in README don’t match config/models.yaml, which is confusing for users.
- Inconsistent timeouts semantics and token budgets:
  - The code treats max_tokens as input budget; for some providers it’s completion tokens. Could create confusing warnings.

Minor
- Event-loop blocking behavior for all tools other than fiedler_send (they are cheap now, but consistently using asyncio.to_thread for sync tools could be safer).
- Error responses are plain text rather than structured MCP error types (acceptable but less rich).
- Logging duplication around package compilation status messages.
- No graceful warning for large files or non-UTF-8 content in compile_package.
- State file writes lack concurrency protection (low risk here).
- Some unused imports and minor style nits.

4) Specific Code Corrections (with file:line references)

Note: Line numbers are approximate. Search by function name or surrounding code if line numbers differ.

A) Fix config path resolution everywhere

Create a shared helper to locate config/models.yaml. Use parents[2] from any module in fiedler/… (fiedler/<module> -> parent: fiedler, parents[2]: project root).

- New file: fiedler/utils/paths.py (add)
  1: from pathlib import Path
  2: def get_config_path() -> Path:
  3:     return Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2] / "config" / "models.yaml"

Then update modules to use it.

- fiedler/tools/models.py
  - Lines ~17-22:
    Replace:
      config_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "config" / "models.yaml"
    With:
      from ..utils.paths import get_config_path
      config_path = get_config_path()

- fiedler/tools/config.py
  - Lines ~18-22:
    Replace:
      config_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "config" / "models.yaml"
    With:
      from ..utils.paths import get_config_path
      config_path = get_config_path()

- fiedler/utils/state.py
  - At top:
    Add:
      from .paths import get_config_path
  - Lines ~40-46 (load_state arg usage is fine), but get_models/get_output_dir currently compute a wrong path:
    Replace in get_models():
      config_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "config" / "models.yaml"
    With:
      config_path = get_config_path()
    Replace in get_output_dir():
      config_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "config" / "models.yaml"
    With:
      config_path = get_config_path()

- fiedler/tools/send.py
  - Lines ~38-43:
    Replace:
      config_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "config" / "models.yaml"
    With:
      from ..utils.paths import get_config_path
      config_path = get_config_path()

B) Make console entrypoint synchronous and call asyncio.run

- fiedler/server.py
  - Around line ~77:
    Change:
      async def main():
          ...
    To:
      async def _amain():
          from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server
          async with stdio_server() as (read_stream, write_stream):
              await app.run(read_stream, write_stream, app.create_initialization_options())

      def main():
          asyncio.run(_amain())

    Keep the if __name__ == "__main__": main() or leave as asyncio.run(_amain()) but ensure main() is sync for console scripts.

C) Offload fiedler_send in call_tool to a background thread

- fiedler/server.py
  - In call_tool():
    Replace:
      elif name == "fiedler_send":
          result = fiedler_send(...)
    With:
      elif name == "fiedler_send":
          result = await asyncio.to_thread(
              fiedler_send,
              prompt=arguments["prompt"],
              files=arguments.get("files"),
              models=arguments.get("models"),
          )

D) Fix OpenAI provider parameter

- fiedler/providers/openai.py
  - Lines ~23-35:
    Replace:
      response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
          model=self.model_id,
          messages=[{"role": "user", "content": full_input}],
          max_completion_tokens=self.max_tokens,
          timeout=self.timeout,
      )
    With:
      response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
          model=self.model_id,
          messages=[{"role": "user", "content": full_input}],
          max_tokens=self.max_tokens,
          timeout=self.timeout,
      )

E) Align compile_package metadata with fiedler_send expectations, and add total_lines

- fiedler/utils/package.py
  - Update return metadata:
    After reading each file, track line count:
      total_lines = 0
      ...
      content = f.read()
      total_lines += content.count("\n") + (1 if content and not content.endswith("\n") else 0)
    At return:
      return package, {"num_files": len(files), "total_size": total_bytes, "total_lines": total_lines}
  - If no files, return:
      return "", {"num_files": 0, "total_size": 0, "total_lines": 0}

F) Fix fiedler_send package metadata logging, alias resolution, and guard for empty models

- fiedler/tools/send.py
  - Import alias map builder:
    from .models import build_alias_map
  - After loading config (just after reading YAML), add alias resolution for override models:
    if models is None:
        models = get_models() or config.get("defaults", {}).get("models", [])
    else:
        alias_map = build_alias_map(config)
        try:
            models = [alias_map[m] if m in alias_map else m for m in models]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown model or alias in models: {models}")

    if not models:
        raise ValueError("No models configured. Use fiedler_set_models or pass models to fiedler_send.")
  - Fix metadata logging lines ~115-118:
    Replace:
      logger.log(f"Compiling package from {len(files)} file(s)")
      package, package_metadata = compile_package(files, logger)
      logger.log(f"Package compiled: {package_metadata['total_size']} bytes, {package_metadata['total_lines']} lines")
    With:
      logger.log(f"Compiling package from {len(files)} file(s)")
      package, package_metadata = compile_package(files, logger)
      logger.log(f"Package compiled: {package_metadata['total_size']} bytes, {package_metadata['total_lines']} lines")
  - Remove the unused lock param:
    - Delete creation of lock = threading.Lock() and remove from send_to_model signature and executor.submit call, and the param in function definition.

G) Prefix warning string in token budget check to satisfy tests

- fiedler/utils/tokens.py
  - Lines ~28-40:
    Replace returned warning messages with prefixed variants:
      if estimated > max_tokens:
          return (False, estimated, f"WARNING: {model_name}: Input ({estimated} tokens) exceeds max ({max_tokens})")
      elif estimated > threshold:
          return (True, estimated, f"WARNING: {model_name}: Input ({estimated} tokens) near limit ({max_tokens})")
      else:
          return (True, estimated, "")

H) Add capabilities to config/models.yaml as required by tests

- config/models.yaml
  For each model under providers.*.models.* add:
    capabilities: ["text"]

  Example:
    gemini-2.5-pro:
      aliases: [gemini]
      max_tokens: 32768
      timeout: 600
      retry_attempts: 3
      capabilities: ["text"]

  Repeat for all models (openai/gpt-5, together.* models, xai/grok-4-0709).

I) Minor: remove unused imports and fix __main__ guard

- fiedler/server.py
  - Remove unused import sys at top.
  - At bottom:
      if __name__ == "__main__":
          main()

5) Recommended Changes (prioritized)

1. Apply all Critical fixes above to make the server and tests run:
   - Centralize config path resolution via utils.paths.get_config_path().
   - Fix console entrypoint to be synchronous and call asyncio.run.
   - Fix OpenAI provider (max_tokens).
   - Fix package metadata mismatch and add total_lines.
   - Resolve model aliases in fiedler_send and guard against empty model sets.
   - Offload fiedler_send execution in call_tool with asyncio.to_thread.
   - Add capabilities: ["text"] in config/models.yaml.
   - Update token warning messages to include "WARNING:".

2. Improve subprocess provider portability:
   - Replace hard-coded Python and script paths with environment variables:
     - GEMINI_CLIENT_PY, GROK_CLIENT_PY, and use sys.executable by default.
   - Validate existence and give actionable error messages.

3. Strengthen error handling and validation:
   - Validate file size and encoding in compile_package (e.g., raise on >N MB or suggest binary handling).
   - Surface structured MCP errors (e.g., use tool-specific error details in JSON) instead of plain text when possible.
   - Add per-provider timeout and error classification (429, 5xx backoff jitter).

4. Async tool standardization:
   - Wrap all blocking tools (even quick ones) with asyncio.to_thread for consistency.
   - Consider using asyncio + aiohttp for providers that support async SDKs.

5. Logging and telemetry:
   - Include per-model request/response sizes and retry counts in summary.json.
   - Add a top-level elapsed time and overall status in logs and summary.

6. Configuration and documentation alignment:
   - Align README’s “Available Models” and token limits with config/models.yaml.
   - Document environment variables for subprocess wrappers and optional overrides.
   - Add an example of alias usage in fiedler_send tool call.

7. State management robustness:
   - Add a file lock (e.g., portalocker) for ~/.fiedler/state.yaml writes to avoid race conditions.
   - Validate that output_dir is writable; create it eagerly on set.

8. Performance:
   - Cap ThreadPoolExecutor max_workers to a reasonable default (e.g., min(8, len(models))) to prevent excessive threads.
   - Add per-call timeout aggregation to avoid runs that never complete.

6) Testing Recommendations

- Fix and expand current tests:
  - Update config/models.yaml to include capabilities so test_models_yaml_structure passes.
  - Update token budget warnings to include “WARNING”.
  - Add a test for alias override in fiedler_send:
    - Mock providers (inject a DummyProvider in create_provider or monkeypatch providers) to avoid real API calls and verify:
      - Alias resolution works.
      - Parallel execution returns per-model outputs.
      - Summary.json is written with expected fields.
  - Add a test for an empty models list passed to fiedler_send to ensure it raises a helpful ValueError.
  - Add a test for the MCP server call_tool:
    - Spin up the server in-process and call list_tools and fiedler_get_config using the MCP client (or mock app.run); verify schemas and outputs.
  - Add a test for retry logic:
    - Mock a provider to fail twice then succeed; assert retries and durations are captured.
  - Add a test for compile_package:
    - Include small text files and verify total_size, total_lines, and num_files are correct.
  - Add a test for Together/OpenAI parameter mapping:
    - Mock OpenAI client and assert max_tokens is passed (not max_completion_tokens).

- CI considerations:
  - Add pytest to dev dependencies and set up a CI job (GitHub Actions).
  - Use environment variables to skip real-provider tests, and run only mock-based tests in CI.

Bugs Summary (most important to fix immediately)

- Incorrect config path references (breaks tools and tests).
- Async console entrypoint (breaks CLI/server launch).
- OpenAI provider parameter (max_tokens).
- compile_package metadata mismatch with fiedler_send.
- Missing alias resolution in fiedler_send.
- Event loop blocking on fiedler_send.
- Missing capabilities in config/models.yaml.
- Token warning format vs tests.

Once these are addressed, the implementation will be correct, complete against the stated requirements, and ready for integration as an MCP server.
