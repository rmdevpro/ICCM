### Security Assessment

The keyring integration feature represents a solid enhancement to Fiedler by introducing secure, OS-native encrypted storage for API keys, reducing reliance on plaintext environment variables. By prioritizing keyring retrieval over env vars and leveraging established mechanisms like macOS Keychain (AES-256), Windows Credential Manager (DPAPI), and Linux Secret Service (D-Bus), the implementation aligns with best practices for credential management. The fallback logic is appropriately designed to maintain usability without compromising security, and the new tools (fiedler_set_key, fiedler_list_keys, fiedler_delete_key) provide a user-friendly interface with basic validation for providers and non-empty keys. However, while the core security is sound, there are minor gaps in robustness, such as broad exception handling, lack of API key format validation, and hardcoded provider lists, which could lead to edge-case issues or maintenance challenges. Overall, this feature improves security posture without introducing obvious vulnerabilities, though it assumes users have the keyring library installed and handles multi-user scenarios via OS-level isolation.

Backward compatibility is preserved, as existing env var-based setups continue to function via fallback, and no breaking changes are evident in the modified providers or server registration. Documentation appears clear in the added SECURITY.md and README.md sections, but could benefit from explicit warnings about shared systems and dependency installation.

### Issues Found

**Critical (Immediate threats to security or functionality):**
- None identified. The integration does not expose keys in plaintext (beyond the fallback), and storage relies on trusted OS mechanisms without custom encryption logic that could be flawed.

**Major (Significant risks or potential for exploitation if not addressed):**
- Broad exception catching in `get_api_key` (fiedler/utils/secrets.py) swallows all exceptions during keyring access, which could mask underlying issues like keyring backend failures or permission problems, potentially leading to silent fallbacks to less secure env vars without user awareness.
- Hardcoded list of known providers in `list_stored_providers` (fiedler/utils/secrets.py) and validation in tools (fiedler/tools/keys.py) limits extensibility; adding a new provider would require code changes, risking inconsistencies if not updated everywhere.

**Minor (Usability, maintainability, or low-risk issues):**
- No validation of API key format before storage in `fiedler_set_key` (fiedler/tools/keys.py), which could allow invalid keys (e.g., wrong length or prefix for a provider) to be stored, leading to runtime errors later.
- In multi-user environments (e.g., shared Linux servers), while keyring is per-user, there's no explicit documentation or handling for scenarios where users might inadvertently access or conflict with system-wide keyrings if permissions are misconfigured.
- Error messages in tools (e.g., when keyring is unavailable) are informative but could be more actionable, such as suggesting alternatives or logging details.
- Dependency on `keyring` library is added without version pinning in a way that considers potential future vulnerabilities, though the specified >=24.0.0 is reasonable.

### Specific Code Corrections

- **fiedler/utils/secrets.py: Line ~30 (in get_api_key)**: Replace `except Exception:` with more specific handling, e.g., `except keyring.errors.KeyringError as e:` to catch keyring-specific issues, log them (e.g., via logging module), and proceed to fallback. This prevents masking non-keyring errors.
- **fiedler/utils/secrets.py: Line ~100 (in list_stored_providers)**: Replace hardcoded `known_providers = ["google", "openai", "together", "xai"]` with a dynamic import from a config file or central provider registry to improve maintainability and avoid duplication with tools in fiedler/tools/keys.py.
- **fiedler/tools/keys.py: Line ~20 (in fiedler_set_key)**: After validating non-empty, add provider-specific format checks, e.g., `if provider == "openai" and not api_key.startswith("sk-"): raise ValueError("Invalid OpenAI key format")`. Similar for other providers.
- **fiedler/tools/keys.py: Line ~10 (valid_providers list)**: Synchronize this list with a shared constant or config to match the one in secrets.py, reducing risk of drift.
- **fiedler/providers/openai.py (and similar for other providers): Line ~10 (in __init__)**: Enhance the ValueError message to include keyring installation instructions, e.g., `raise ValueError(f"No API key found... Install keyring with 'pip install keyring' for secure storage.")`.

### Security Recommendations

- Implement optional key format validation during storage to prevent invalid keys from being saved, reducing debugging overhead. This could be provider-specific (e.g., regex checks for OpenAI's "sk-" prefix) and configurable to avoid blocking edge cases.
- Enhance multi-user support by adding documentation in SECURITY.md about OS-specific behaviors (e.g., "On shared systems, ensure user-level permissions; keyring does not support multi-tenant isolation beyond OS defaults"). Consider an optional flag for tools to specify a custom service name for isolation.
- Strengthen fallback logic by adding a configurable option to disable env var fallback entirely for high-security environments, forcing keyring usage.
- Audit the keyring library dependency regularly for vulnerabilities (e.g., via tools like pip-audit) and consider alternatives or wrappers if backend-specific issues arise (e.g., Linux D-Bus dependencies).
- Add logging for all key access attempts (successful and failed) in get_api_key, with configurable log levels, to aid in monitoring and debugging without exposing sensitive data.
- Ensure documentation includes clear guidance on migration from env vars to keyring, including risks of env var exposure (e.g., in process lists or logs).

### Testing Recommendations

- **Unit Tests**: Add tests for each function in secrets.py and keys.py, covering happy paths (key storage/retrieval), errors (keyring unavailable, invalid providers/keys), and edge cases (empty keys, non-existent providers). Mock the keyring library to avoid OS dependencies in tests.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify provider initialization with keyring priority (e.g., set key in keyring, unset env var, confirm client initializes; then reverse). Test fallback by uninstalling keyring temporarily.
- **Security-Specific Tests**: Simulate multi-user scenarios (e.g., via Docker containers with different users) to ensure no cross-user key leakage. Fuzz inputs to tools for injection risks (though low due to validation). Test error handling by forcing keyring failures (e.g., mock exceptions).
- **Platform Tests**: Run tests across macOS, Windows, and Linux to validate OS-specific backends, including cases where backends are unavailable (e.g., headless Linux without D-Bus).
- **Backward Compatibility Tests**: Confirm existing env var-based setups work unchanged, and that adding keyring doesn't alter behavior for users without it installed.
- **Automated Scanning**: Use tools like Bandit for static analysis of the new code, and dependency checkers for the keyring library. Include performance tests to ensure keyring access doesn't introduce significant latency.
