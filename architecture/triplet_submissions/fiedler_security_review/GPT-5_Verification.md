1) Security Assessment

Overall, the design is sound: prioritizing OS-native keyrings and only falling back to environment variables is the right model, and not exposing any “get key” tool avoids accidental exfiltration. However, there are two high-impact gaps: (a) no verification of which keyring backend is actually being used (on Linux and CI/headless environments, keyring can select an insecure plaintext backend if available), and (b) the API key flows through an MCP tool argument and may be logged/telemetered by the surrounding server or client. Both issues can lead to secret exposure despite using a keyring.

Error handling is resilient in get_api_key (don’t crash, fall back to env), which is good for availability, but it silently downgrades security without signaling the user/admin. Tools catch too narrow an exception (RuntimeError only), which can result in unhandled errors from keyring. Documentation is directionally correct but should explicitly warn about insecure backends and logging/transport considerations, and provide guidance to lock down behavior in high-security contexts.


2) Issues Found

Critical
- Insecure keyring backend acceptance (Linux/headless/CI may use plaintext backends): The code treats any “keyring available” backend as secure. On systems with keyrings.alt installed or misconfigured desktop services, the backend can be plaintext (e.g., keyrings.alt.file.PlaintextKeyring), causing cleartext storage on disk. Impact: silent secret compromise. Files: fiedler/utils/secrets.py (set_api_key, delete_api_key, get_api_key, list_stored_providers).
- Potential secret exposure via logging/telemetry of tool arguments: The fiedler_set_key tool takes api_key as a normal string argument. If the MCP server, surrounding framework, or any middleware logs tool calls/arguments (common in debug/telemetry), the key can be written to logs. Impact: immediate secret disclosure. Files: fiedler/tools/keys.py; fiedler/server.py.

Major
- Incomplete exception handling of keyring operations: Tools only catch RuntimeError, but keyring raises keyring.errors.KeyringError subclasses (e.g., PasswordSetError, PasswordDeleteError, InitError). Unhandled exceptions can crash tool calls and potentially expose stack traces. Files: fiedler/tools/keys.py (fiedler_set_key, fiedler_delete_key).
- Silent security downgrade on keyring errors: get_api_key swallows exceptions and falls back to env var without warning. Users may believe keys are coming from the encrypted store when they are not. Files: fiedler/utils/secrets.py:get_api_key.
- No “require secure keyring” or “disable env fallback” control: High-security deployments often must fail hard if secure storage is unavailable. Currently impossible. Files: fiedler/utils/secrets.py and configuration.
- Transport assumptions not documented/enforced: set_key sends the API key over the MCP channel. If the MCP connection crosses trust boundaries (remote, shared hosts), or logs requests, the secret can be exposed. This must be documented and, where possible, restricted/redacted. Files: SECURITY.md/README.md, server setup.

Minor
- Trimming and basic format validation: api_key is only checked for non-empty; accidental whitespace and obviously invalid values aren’t handled. Files: fiedler/tools/keys.py (fiedler_set_key).
- Delete error handling too narrow: Only PasswordDeleteError is caught; other KeyringError types (or platform-specific errors) may bubble. Files: fiedler/utils/secrets.py:delete_api_key.
- Backend visibility and diagnostics: No way to see which keyring backend is in use; list_stored_providers may mislead users if backend is insecure or unavailable. Files: fiedler/utils/secrets.py; fiedler/tools/keys.py (fiedler_list_keys).
- Provider list duplication: Provider lists are hard-coded in multiple places; drift can cause inconsistent tool behavior (not a security bug, but maintainability risk). Files: fiedler/tools/keys.py, fiedler/utils/secrets.py.


3) Specific Code Corrections

Note: Line numbers are approximate based on the provided snippets.

fiedler/utils/secrets.py
- Add secure-backend check and logging:
  - Around top of file (after imports), add:
    import logging
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
  - Add helper (around line ~20):
    def _get_backend_name() -> str:
        if not KEYRING_AVAILABLE:
            return "unavailable"
        kr = keyring.get_keyring()
        return f"{kr.__class__.__module__}.{kr.__class__.__name__}"

    def _is_secure_backend() -> tuple[bool, str]:
        """
        Returns (is_secure, backend_name). Treats OS-native backends as secure.
        Rejects known insecure/plaintext/disabled backends.
        """
        if not KEYRING_AVAILABLE:
            return (False, "unavailable")
        backend_name = _get_backend_name()
        insecure_prefixes = (
            "keyrings.alt.",            # plaintext/file-based backends
            "keyring.backends.null",    # no-op backend
            "keyring.backends.fail",    # failing backend
        )
        if backend_name.startswith(insecure_prefixes):
            return (False, backend_name)
        # Allow common secure backends
        allowed = {
            "keyring.backends.macOS.Keyring",
            "keyring.backends.Windows.WinVaultKeyring",
            "keyring.backends.SecretService.Keyring",
            "keyring.backends.kwallet.DBusKeyring",  # optional if you intend to allow KWallet
        }
        return (backend_name in allowed, backend_name)

    def _require_secure_keyring() -> bool:
        # Controlled by env; default false to preserve backward compatibility
        return os.getenv("FIEDLER_REQUIRE_SECURE_KEYRING", "0") in ("1", "true", "yes")

  - In get_api_key (around lines ~33-43):
    - When catching Exception, log a warning so operators know a downgrade occurred:
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning("Keyring get_password failed for provider=%s using backend=%s; falling back to env var: %s",
                           provider, _get_backend_name() if KEYRING_AVAILABLE else "unavailable", e)
    - Optional: if _require_secure_keyring() is true, do NOT silently fall back; instead return None to force an error at the caller or raise a clearer exception:
        if _require_secure_keyring():
            logger.error("Secure keyring required but unavailable or failed (backend=%s); refusing env fallback.",
                         _get_backend_name() if KEYRING_AVAILABLE else "unavailable")
            return None
  - In set_api_key (around lines ~55-65):
    - Before keyring.set_password:
        if _require_secure_keyring():
            is_secure, backend = _is_secure_backend()
            if not is_secure:
                raise RuntimeError(f"Insecure or unavailable keyring backend ({backend}). Refusing to store secret. "
                                   "Install/enable an OS-native keyring or unset FIEDLER_REQUIRE_SECURE_KEYRING.")
        else:
            is_secure, backend = _is_secure_backend()
            if not is_secure:
                logger.warning("Storing key using a non-secure keyring backend (%s). Consider enabling "
                               "FIEDLER_REQUIRE_SECURE_KEYRING=1.", backend)
    - Wrap set_password to surface KeyringError cleanly:
        try:
            keyring.set_password(SERVICE_NAME, provider, api_key)
        except Exception as e:
            # Prefer keyring.errors.KeyringError but keep Exception to be safe across backends
            raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to store API key in keyring (backend={_get_backend_name()}): {e}") from e
  - In delete_api_key (around lines ~73-90):
    - Catch broader errors:
        except Exception:
            return False
  - In list_stored_providers (around lines ~97-118):
    - Expose backend for diagnostics and guard insecure:
        is_secure, backend = _is_secure_backend()
        if not KEYRING_AVAILABLE:
            return []
        # Optionally, if backend insecure and REQUIRE is set, return [] or raise to reflect locked state.

fiedler/tools/keys.py
- Redact/trim api_key and handle keyring-specific errors:
  - In fiedler_set_key (around lines ~14-48):
    - Before storing:
        api_key = api_key.strip()
    - Wrap set_api_key in broader try/except:
        try:
            set_api_key(provider, api_key)
            return {...}
        except Exception as e:
            # Do not include the key; include backend info if you also expose it via a helper
            return {
                "status": "error",
                "provider": provider,
                "message": str(e),
                "storage": "unavailable"
            }
- In fiedler_delete_key (around lines ~50-83):
    - Catch broader errors:
        except Exception as e:
            return {"status": "error", "provider": provider, "message": str(e)}
- In fiedler_list_keys (around lines ~85-101):
    - Consider returning backend info for transparency:
        from ..utils.secrets import KEYRING_AVAILABLE, _get_backend_name  # if exposed
        "backend": _get_backend_name() if KEYRING_AVAILABLE else "unavailable"

fiedler/server.py (tool schemas)
- Mark api_key as sensitive to reduce accidental logging and enable UI redaction:
  - In the Tool schema for fiedler_set_key, add:
        "api_key": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "API key to store (will be encrypted by OS keyring)",
            "format": "password",
            "writeOnly": true,
            "x-sensitive": true
        }
  - Ensure any request/response logging in the server masks fields with writeOnly/x-sensitive.

Provider updates (e.g., fiedler/providers/openai.py)
- Optional: when get_api_key returns None due to REQUIRE flag, include backend advice in the error message:
    raise ValueError("No API key found for OpenAI. If you intended to use the system keyring, ensure a secure "
                     "keyring backend is available or disable FIEDLER_REQUIRE_SECURE_KEYRING. "
                     f"Alternatively set {api_key_env}.")


4) Security Recommendations

- Enforce or at least expose secure keyring backend status:
  - Implement _is_secure_backend as above and refuse storage when FIEDLER_REQUIRE_SECURE_KEYRING=1.
  - Surface the active backend name in fiedler_list_keys and logs to aid operators.
  - Explicitly disallow keyrings.alt/plaintext/Null/Fail backends by default when REQUIRE is enabled.

- Redact secrets and harden telemetry:
  - Treat api_key as sensitive everywhere. Mask in logs, traces, analytics, crash reports.
  - Add schema hints (format=password, writeOnly, x-sensitive) and ensure your logging layer respects them.
  - Add an integration test that verifies logs do not contain api_key values.

- Provide a “no-fallback” hardening option:
  - FIEDLER_REQUIRE_SECURE_KEYRING=1 should both (a) reject set_key if the backend is insecure/unavailable, and (b) make get_api_key return None (or raise) instead of falling back to env vars. This prevents silent downgrades.

- Document transport/trust boundaries:
  - SECURITY.md and README.md should warn that fiedler_set_key transmits the key over the MCP channel. Use only trusted clients and local/secured transports (e.g., local stdio, SSH tunnels). Disable or restrict remote access to the server if not necessary.

- Validate inputs cautiously:
  - Trim whitespace and optionally apply lightweight provider-specific heuristics (e.g., prefix checks like “sk-” for OpenAI, etc.) with clear messaging; avoid over-strict regex that may break future formats.
  - Consider offering a “test key” action per provider to validate credentials via a minimal API call (opt-in, offline-safe by default).

- Dependency hygiene:
  - Keep keyring current (e.g., >=24.0.0 is fine; consider pinning to a tested range like >=24,<26).
  - Do not depend on keyrings.alt; document that installing keyrings.alt is discouraged in production.

- Operational guidance:
  - Add a migration note: “Run fiedler_set_key once and then remove the API key from your environment to avoid plaintext exposure.”
  - Add a section on Linux caveats (Secret Service requires a D-Bus session; headless servers may need gnome-keyring/kwallet or an SSH agent/session wrapper).

- Defensive coding:
  - Catch keyring.errors.KeyringError broadly wherever interacting with keyring and convert to user-friendly errors.
  - Log warnings on downgrades and backend issues without leaking secrets.


5) Testing Recommendations

Unit tests
- Backend selection and enforcement:
  - Monkeypatch keyring.get_keyring() to return classes emulating:
    - Secure backends (macOS, Windows, SecretService): set_api_key succeeds.
    - Insecure backends (keyrings.alt.* / Null / Fail): set_api_key fails when FIEDLER_REQUIRE_SECURE_KEYRING=1 and warns otherwise.
- Fallback behavior:
  - get_api_key returns keyring value when available.
  - When keyring.get_password raises, verify:
    - With REQUIRE off: env var is used and a warning is logged.
    - With REQUIRE on: returns None (or raises) and no env fallback occurs.
- Exception handling:
  - Simulate keyring.set_password/delete_password raising KeyringError; ensure tools return status="error" without crashing.
- Input handling:
  - api_key is trimmed; empty or whitespace-only keys are rejected.
  - Invalid provider names raise ValueError.

Integration/E2E tests
- Cross-platform sanity:
  - macOS: store/list/delete; verify Keychain item appears under service “fiedler-mcp-server”.
  - Windows: store/list/delete via DPAPI; ensure key is not accessible by another user account.
  - Linux desktop: with Secret Service available, verify prompts/behavior; headless environment should fail or warn as configured.
- Logging redaction:
  - Run the MCP server with representative logging enabled; execute fiedler_set_key and assert logs contain no api_key plaintext (use a unique sentinel string).
- Transport consideration:
  - If you support remote MCP connections, test over that transport and verify TLS/SSH or equivalent is required and that payloads aren’t logged upstream.

Documentation checks
- SECURITY.md should:
  - Explain backend enforcement and FIEDLER_REQUIRE_SECURE_KEYRING.
  - Warn about logging and transport considerations.
  - Provide Linux headless setup steps and discourage keyrings.alt in production.
  - Provide migration guidance from env vars.

Answering the Review Questions concisely
1) Security: Core design is solid but vulnerable if an insecure keyring backend is used and if tool arguments are logged. Add backend checks, redaction, and hardening mode.
2) Fallback Logic: Functional, but without signaling it silently downgrades security. Provide a “require secure keyring” option and log warnings when falling back.
3) Error Handling: Reasonable in get_api_key; insufficient in tools for keyring-specific exceptions. Catch keyring.errors.KeyringError and convert to user-friendly errors.
4) Key Validation: Add trimming and lightweight provider-specific heuristics; avoid strict regex. Optionally provide a “test key” action.
5) Multi-User: Per-OS keyrings are user-scoped; generally fine. Document that keys are per user and that Linux backends vary; avoid shared service accounts without secure keyring.
6) Documentation: Good start; add explicit warnings about insecure backends, logging/telemetry, MCP transport, and hardening options.
7) Backward Compatibility: Providers still accept env vars; behavior is compatible. Add an opt-in hardening flag to avoid breaking existing workflows.
8) Dependencies: keyring>=24.0.0 is acceptable. Avoid keyrings.alt in production; document that and consider a tested version range.
