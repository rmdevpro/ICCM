# Claude Code Restart Status - 2025-10-02 21:05 EDT

## 🟡 Restart #3 - Partial Success (Fiedler ✅, Dewey ❌)

### What Loaded
- ✅ Fiedler MCP: 5 tools available via relay→KGB→Winni chain
- ❌ Dewey MCP: 0 tools (not connecting)

### Next Steps
1. Check dewey-mcp container status
2. Check relay logs for dewey connection attempts
3. Diagnose why dewey route failing while fiedler working

## ✅✅✅ Global MCP Config Fix (Gemini Assisted) - Applied for Restart #3

### Global MCP Configuration Fix (2025-10-02 20:08)

**Problem Found:**
- After restart #2, MCP tools STILL not loading
- Config was correct, trust was enabled, but tools unavailable
- Claude Code wasn't even attempting to connect to MCP servers
- Root cause discovered by **Gemini 2.5 Pro analysis**

**Root Cause (Diagnosed by Gemini):**
- MCP servers were in **project-specific** config: `projects."/home/aristotle9".mcpServers`
- This only loads when working directory is EXACTLY `/home/aristotle9`
- Claude Code was likely not starting from that exact directory
- **Solution:** Move MCP servers to **global** config file

**Fix Applied:**
1. Created `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` with fiedler + dewey definitions
2. Removed fiedler + dewey from project-specific `~/.claude.json`
3. Bonus: Cleaned massive conversation history (105KB → 5KB)

**Files:**
```json
# NEW: ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json (global)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fiedler": {
      "transport": {"type": "ws", "url": "ws://localhost:8000?upstream=fiedler"}
    },
    "dewey": {
      "transport": {"type": "ws", "url": "ws://localhost:8000?upstream=dewey"}
    }
  }
}
```

**Backups:**
- `~/.claude.json.backup-gemini-clean-20251002-200825` (full backup)
- Gemini analysis: `/tmp/gemini_analysis.md`

**How Gemini Helped:**
- .claude.json was 33,241 tokens (too large for Claude to read in one pass)
- Sent entire file to Gemini 2.5 Pro for analysis
- Gemini identified the project-specific vs global config issue
- Gemini also provided cleaned config removing history bloat

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Restart Claude Code (#3) to load MCP servers globally

## ✅✅ MCP Trust Dialog Fixed - Ready for Restart #2

### MCP Trust Dialog Fix (2025-10-02 19:55)

**Problem Found:**
- After restart #1, MCP servers still not loading
- All MCP tools unavailable (fiedler, dewey, desktop-commander, etc.)
- Config format was correct, but tools still blocked
- Root cause: `hasTrustDialogAccepted: false` in ~/.claude.json
- This flag blocks ALL MCP servers from loading, even if correctly configured

**Investigation:**
- Containers healthy ✅
- Config syntax valid ✅
- Config format correct ✅
- Relay chain working ✅
- But no connection attempts from Claude Code ❌
- Found: Trust dialog never accepted for this project

**Fix Applied:**
- Set `hasTrustDialogAccepted = true` for /home/aristotle9 project
- Backup: ~/.claude.json.backup-trust-20251002-195524
- Both config format AND trust now correct

**Impact:**
- This was blocking all 9 configured MCP servers:
  - fiedler, dewey (our custom servers)
  - herodotus, grok, desktop-commander (other configured servers)
  - All MCP functionality completely unavailable

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Restart Claude Code (#2) to load MCP servers

---

## ✅ MCP Config Format Fixed - Ready for Restart

### MCP Config Format Fix (2025-10-02 23:52)

**Problem Found:**
- Fiedler MCP tools not loading after restart
- Wrong config format: `{"url": "ws://localhost:8000?upstream=fiedler"}`
- Correct format: `{"transport": {"type": "ws", "url": "..."}}`

**Fix Applied:**
- Fixed both fiedler and dewey in ~/.claude.json
- Backup: ~/.claude.json.backup-fix-[timestamp]
- Verified correct format with jq

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Restart Claude Code to reload config

---

## ✅ Previous Bug Fix - websockets 15.x

### Websockets 15.x Bug Fixed (2025-10-02 23:39)

**Problem Found:**
- stable-relay was crashing on connection attempts
- Error: `TypeError: StableRelay.handle_client() missing 1 required positional argument: 'path'`
- Claude Code couldn't connect to any MCP servers

**Root Cause:**
- websockets library 15.x changed handler signature
- Old API: `handler(websocket, path)`
- New API: `handler(websocket)` with path in `websocket.request.path`

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `/mnt/projects/ICCM/stable-relay/relay.py:55-60`
- Changed `async def handle_client(self, client_ws, path):` to `async def handle_client(self, client_ws):`
- Added path extraction: `path = client_ws.request.path if hasattr(client_ws, 'request') else "/"`
- Rebuilt and restarted stable-relay container

**Verification:**
- ✅ stable-relay accepts connections without errors
- ✅ Full chain tested: stable-relay → KGB → fiedler-mcp
- ✅ KGB spy recruitment working
- ✅ All containers healthy

### Container Status
```
stable-relay   Up 2 minutes (healthy)    127.0.0.1:8000->8000/tcp
kgb-proxy      Up 40 minutes             127.0.0.1:9000->9000/tcp
fiedler-mcp    Up 39 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:9010->8080/tcp
dewey-mcp      Up 2 hours (healthy)      127.0.0.1:9020->9020/tcp
```

### Configuration Files Fixed

**Both config files now point to stable-relay (port 8000):**
- ✅ `~/.claude.json` → `ws://localhost:8000?upstream=fiedler` / `dewey`
- ✅ `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` → `ws://localhost:8000?upstream=fiedler` / `dewey`

**Backup created:**
- `~/.claude.json.backup-20251002-230732`

### Architecture Flow

```
Claude Code
    ↓ ws://localhost:8000?upstream=fiedler
    ↓ ws://localhost:8000?upstream=dewey
Stable Relay (port 8000)
    ↓ ws://kgb-proxy:9000?upstream=fiedler
    ↓ ws://kgb-proxy:9000?upstream=dewey
KGB Proxy (port 9000)
    ├─→ ws://fiedler-mcp:8080 (Fiedler MCP)
    └─→ ws://dewey-mcp:9020 (Dewey MCP)
```

## 🔄 REQUIRED: Restart Claude Code

**After restart, test:**

1. **Check stable-relay logs** (should see new connections):
   ```bash
   docker logs stable-relay --tail 20
   ```

2. **Check KGB logs** (should see spy recruitment):
   ```bash
   docker logs kgb-proxy --tail 30
   ```

3. **Test Fiedler tools** - Should see tools available:
   - `mcp__fiedler__fiedler_get_config`
   - `mcp__fiedler__fiedler_list_models`
   - `mcp__fiedler__fiedler_send`

4. **Test Dewey tools** - Should see tools available:
   - `mcp__dewey__dewey_list_conversations`
   - `mcp__dewey__dewey_begin_conversation`

5. **Verify full chain**:
   - Stable-relay should log: "Client connected" and "Backend connected"
   - KGB should log: "Spy recruited for upstream: fiedler/dewey"
   - Fiedler/Dewey should log: "Client connected"

6. **Check auto-logging** (after using Fiedler):
   ```bash
   # Connect to PostgreSQL and check conversations table
   psql -U dewey -h irina -d winni -c "SELECT conversation_id, session_id, created_at FROM conversations ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"
   ```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Restart

**Success indicators:**
- ✅ Fiedler tools appear in tool list
- ✅ Dewey tools appear in tool list
- ✅ Stable-relay logs show connections from Claude Code
- ✅ KGB logs show spy recruitment for both upstreams
- ✅ Fiedler/Dewey respond to tool calls
- ✅ Conversations auto-logged to PostgreSQL `winni` database

**If tools don't appear:**
1. Check `~/.claude.json` - verify port 8000
2. Check `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` - verify port 8000
3. Check stable-relay logs - should see connection attempts
4. Check KGB logs - look for errors

**Rollback if needed:**
```bash
# Restore stdio config (bypasses all WebSocket, but works)
cp ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json.stdio-backup ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json
# Restart Claude Code again
```

---

**Status**: Ready for restart. All containers healthy, configs corrected.
