# Phase 0: Scope Validation - Triplet Request

## Context

We are beginning the architecture planning process for the ICCM system implementation. Before extracting detailed requirements, we need to validate that our scope definition correctly interprets the research papers and is feasible given our constraints.

## Your Task

Review the attached scope definition document (`scope.md`) and the relevant research papers, then provide feedback on:

1. **IN SCOPE Validation**: Are the items marked IN SCOPE appropriate for a CET-D proof of concept?
2. **OUT OF SCOPE Validation**: Are the deferrals (CET-P, CET-T, production features) justified by the papers?
3. **Missing Critical Items**: Are there any essential components missing from IN SCOPE?
4. **Feasibility Assessment**: Is the scope realistic given these constraints:
   - 5-person research team
   - $7,840 infrastructure budget (3x RTX 4070 Ti Super GPUs, 156GB VRAM total)
   - 50-application validation dataset (40 training, 10 hold-out)
   - Research lab environment (not production)

5. **Paper Alignment**: Does the scope accurately reflect what Papers 01, 04, and 05 describe as the proof-of-concept implementation?

## Key Papers for This Review

**Primary References:**
- **Paper 01** (`01_ICCM_Primary_Paper_v4.1.md`): Overall framework, defines CET-D as proof-of-concept, establishes four-phase training
- **Paper 04** (filename TBD): CET-D Software Implementation details
- **Paper 05** (`05_CET_D_Requirements_Engineering_Implementation_v4.1.md`): Requirements engineering domain specifics, validation methodology

**Supporting Context:**
- **Paper 02**: CET Architecture Specialization (defines CET-D vs CET-P vs CET-T variants)
- **Paper 09**: LLM Orchestra
- **Paper 11**: Testing Infrastructure

## Specific Questions

### 1. Scope Boundary Questions

**CET-D Focus:**
- Papers emphasize CET-D as initial validation before CET-P/CET-T. Is our scope definition correct in deferring CET-P and CET-T?
- Are we missing any CET-D components that are essential for proof-of-concept?

**Requirements Engineering Domain:**
- Is requirements engineering the correct initial domain per the papers?
- Should we include other domains in the proof-of-concept scope?

**Four-Phase Training:**
- Our scope includes all 4 training phases. Should Phase 4 (continuous self-improvement/deployment) be deferred as "production feature"?
- Or is Phase 4 essential to validate the progressive training thesis?

### 2. Infrastructure Feasibility

Given hardware constraints (3x RTX 4070 Ti Super, 156GB VRAM):
- Can we realistically train a 5B parameter CET-D model?
- Can we run multi-LLM ensemble for training data generation?
- Is 50-app dataset sufficient for statistical validation, or should we reconsider?

### 3. Component Identification

Review our IN SCOPE components:
- CET-D Training Pipeline (4 phases)
- LLM Orchestra (multi-LLM coordination)
- Requirements Engineering Domain Logic
- Test Lab Infrastructure (code execution)
- Conversation Storage & Retrieval
- Model Management (checkpoints, versioning)

**Are we missing critical components?** For example:
- RAG system for Phase 1 subject expertise?
- Reconstruction testing pipeline?
- Validation framework?
- Dataset preparation tools?

### 4. Out-of-Scope Validation

We marked these as OUT OF SCOPE:
- CET-P (edge deployment, privacy-preserving)
- CET-T (team collaboration)
- Bidirectional processing
- Production deployment features
- Large-scale datasets (500+, 3000+ apps)

**Are any of these actually required for proof-of-concept validation?**

### 5. Success Criteria Alignment

Our success criteria state the architecture succeeds if:
- All components trace to research papers
- System runs on existing infrastructure
- Supports 50-app validation workflow
- Enables statistical validation (paired t-test)
- Implements all 4 training phases for CET-D
- Provides reconstruction testing pipeline
- Manual validation feasible for 5-person team

**Are these the right success criteria per the papers?**
**Are we missing critical validation requirements?**
