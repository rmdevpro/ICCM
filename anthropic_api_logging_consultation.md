# Anthropic API Logging Design Consultation

## Context

**System:** ICCM (Integrated Cognitive-Cybernetic Methodology)
**Current State:** MCP tool traffic logging works via KGB proxy (WebSocket interception)
**Gap:** Direct Claude Code ↔ Anthropic API conversations are NOT logged

## Architecture Overview

```
Current Logging (WORKS):
Claude Code → MCP Relay → KGB (ws://localhost:9000) → Fiedler/Dewey → Winni DB
                                ↓ (WebSocket spy intercepts)
                             Dewey stores all MCP messages

Not Logged (PROBLEM):
Claude Code → Anthropic API (api.anthropic.com via HTTPS)
```

## Requirements

1. **Capture all conversations** between user and Claude Code (Anthropic API traffic)
2. **Store in Winni database** via Dewey (same as MCP traffic)
3. **Work with containerized Claude Code** (future deployment mode)
4. **Maintain security** (no credential leakage)
5. **Minimal complexity** (prefer simple, maintainable solutions)

## Architecture Diagram Reference

The General Architecture.PNG shows:
- Yellow lines from "Claude Max" cloud to containerized Claude Code
- Note: "General use so that conversations get logged"
- KGB component in middle container with red logging arrows to Dewey

## Current Components

- **KGB**: WebSocket proxy (ws://) with spy pattern, logs to Dewey
- **Dewey**: Conversation storage with MCP interface
- **Winni**: PostgreSQL database (192.168.1.210)
- **Claude Code**: CLI tool connecting to api.anthropic.com

## Question for Triplet

**How should we implement logging of Claude Code ↔ Anthropic API conversations?**

Options being considered:
1. **HTTPS Proxy** (mitmproxy, Squid, custom) - Intercept HTTPS traffic
2. **Claude Code Hook** (if available) - Use built-in logging hooks
3. **Containerized Network Monitor** (tcpdump + parser) - Packet capture
4. **Manual Logging** (workflow) - User triggers save to Dewey periodically
5. **API Wrapper** (modify Claude Code) - Intercept at application layer

**Constraints:**
- Cannot modify Anthropic's servers
- Must work with bare metal AND containerized Claude Code
- Should integrate with existing Dewey/Winni infrastructure
- SSL/TLS certificate trust issues must be addressed

**Please analyze:**
1. Which approach best fits the ICCM architecture?
2. How does this integrate with existing KGB/Dewey components?
3. What are the implementation steps?
4. Are there security or reliability concerns?
5. Is there a simpler approach we're missing?

## Expected Output

Please provide:
1. **Recommended approach** with rationale
2. **Architecture diagram** (ASCII art showing components and data flow)
3. **Implementation steps** (concrete tasks)
4. **Integration points** with existing ICCM infrastructure
5. **Potential issues** and mitigations
