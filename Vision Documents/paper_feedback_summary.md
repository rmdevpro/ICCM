- Define all acronyms on first use
- Create glossary of key terms

### Citation Format
- Use consistent citation style (e.g., APA or ACL)
- Add in-text citations for all claims
- Include comparison table of related work

## Specific Line-by-Line Issues to Address

1. Opening needs stronger hook - consider starting with concrete problem
2. "Crowning achievement" - consider more precise language
3. Brain/AI parallel section - needs neuroscience citations
4. "Angel/devil" metaphor - consider moving to footnote
5. Sequential Thinking MCP example - needs more context
6. "75% context window" - justify this percentage
7. LLM teaming section - compare to ensemble methods
8. Training phases - add flowchart or algorithm listing

## Strengths to Emphasize More

1. **Context Engineering vs Prompt Engineering**: This paradigm shift deserves its own section
2. **Infinite Memory with Finite Attention**: Philosophical implications are profound
3. **LLM Voting System**: Novel approach to training data quality
4. **Dynamic Interleaving**: Sophisticated attention-based insertion

## Suggested Abstract (Draft)

"Current Large Language Models (LLMs) treat context windows as constraints to be overcome rather than fundamental features of intelligent processing. We propose a novel architecture using Specialized Prompt Technology (SPT) models that dynamically generate optimal contexts from infinite conversational memory. Unlike existing retrieval-augmented generation or context compression approaches, SPTs learn to construct context by balancing recency, relevance, and domain-specific importance. We introduce an innovative training methodology using LLM teams with voting mechanisms to generate high-quality training data while mitigating hallucination. Our approach reframes the challenge from extending context windows to engineering optimal contexts, drawing parallels to human cognitive processes of selective attention and memory retrieval. This paradigm shift from prompt engineering to context engineering offers a path toward more efficient and effective long-term conversational AI systems."
