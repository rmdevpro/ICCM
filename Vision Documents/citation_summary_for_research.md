# Citation Summary for Research Deep Dive

## Cognitive Science Foundations
These works establish the theoretical basis for understanding intelligence as conversation-based:

- **Vygotsky (1962)** - How inner speech develops from social interaction to become the foundation of thought
- **Fernyhough (2016)** - Modern evidence that internal dialogue is fundamental to consciousness and decision-making
- **Baddeley (2000)** - The episodic buffer as a bridge between working and long-term memory
- **Cowan (2001)** - Working memory limits (~4 chunks) emphasize selection over storage

**Research Direction**: These suggest that optimal context management should mirror human cognitive constraints and leverage dialogue as the primary reasoning mechanism.

## Memory-Augmented Neural Networks
Foundational work on giving neural networks external memory:

- **Neural Turing Machines (Graves, 2014)** - First differentiable external memory for algorithmic tasks
- **Differentiable Neural Computers (Graves, 2016)** - Sophisticated memory management with allocation/linking
- **Memory Networks (Weston, 2015)** - Explicit memory storage avoiding RNN compression limitations

**Research Direction**: These provide the technical foundation for external memory but lack conversational optimization. Your SPT could leverage their differentiable memory mechanisms while adding conversation-specific features.

## Long Context Management
Approaches to handling more tokens:

- **Memorizing Transformers (Wu, 2022)** - kNN retrieval over past activations
- **RETRO (Borgeaud, 2021)** - Retrieval from 2-trillion token database with cross-attention
- **Unlimiformer (Bertsch, 2023)** - kNN search for relevant hidden states at each layer
- **LongNet (Ding, 2023)** - Dilated attention for billion-token contexts

**Research Direction**: These focus on *extending* context rather than *optimizing* it. Your approach of intelligent selection could be more efficient than brute-force extension.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Using external knowledge during generation:

- **RAG (Lewis, 2020)** - Treats retrieved documents as latent variables
- **REALM (Guu, 2020)** - Joint pre-training of retriever and LM
- **Atlas (Izacard, 2022)** - Small models + massive retrieval beats large models

**Research Direction**: These show retrieval's value but focus on factual knowledge rather than conversational continuity. Your SPT could adapt their retrieval mechanisms for conversation-specific needs.

## Context Compression
Reducing token usage through compression:

- **Gisting (Mu, 2023)** - Learning to compress prompts into "gist" tokens
- **AutoCompressor (Chevalier, 2023)** - Recursive compression into summary vectors
- **LongLLMLingua (Jiang, 2023)** - Perplexity-based token removal for 20x compression

**Research Direction**: These risk information loss through uniform compression. Your dynamic relevance scoring could preserve critical details while removing truly redundant information.

## Most Promising Research Areas to Explore

Based on these summaries, the most promising areas for augmenting your approach appear to be:

1. **Cognitive Science Integration**: Deeper exploration of Baddeley's episodic buffer and Cowan's chunking could inform your relevance scoring and memory organization strategies.

2. **Hybrid Memory Systems**: Combining ideas from DNCs (temporal linking, allocation) with conversation-specific features could create more sophisticated memory management.

3. **Adaptive Retrieval**: REALM's joint training approach could be adapted to learn conversation-specific retrieval patterns rather than factual retrieval.

4. **Selective Compression**: Rather than uniform compression like Gisting/AutoCompressor, your system could learn which conversation elements are compressible vs. which require perfect preservation.

5. **Attention Mechanisms**: LongNet's dilated attention could be adapted to prioritize recent context while maintaining access to distant but relevant conversation history.

6. **RAG-style Marginalization**: RAG's treatment of retrieved documents as latent variables could be applied to conversation chunks, allowing uncertainty over which historical context is most relevant.

The key differentiation of your SPT approach is treating conversation as a first-class citizen rather than generic text, which none of these existing approaches do. This conversation-specific optimization represents the main gap in current research.
