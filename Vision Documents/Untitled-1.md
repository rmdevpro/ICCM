**Intelligent Conversation and Context Management**

LLMs continue to transform how we view AI and its capabilities. GPTs, the underlying technology of the LLMs are a remarkable human achievement that allow for the most complex decision making structure ever engineered. LLMs are perhaps the crowing achievement of the GPT. They are not only relevant to every human in general, but they tap into something deeper. They are conversational.

Converasation is often seen as something people do as part of their thinking, but the more we understand AI, the more we gain a lense into how our brains work, and through LLMs, we better undertand the *thinking vehicle* that conversations truly are.  We have inner conversations with our selves.  We have conversations between our thoughful mind and our overseeing mind (ego and id) and attempted conversations with our unconcious mind.  We have known this for a tremendously long time as seen as anlogies of a devil and angle sitting on your shoulders, each trying to convince you of the right and wrong path.  

In fact LLMs often have these inner dialogs as they attempt to respond to your inputs.  Its a fun thing to install the Sequential  Thinking MCP server with Claude code, because it exposes that inner conversation.   If you have never done this you should. You will be surprised to see how human Claude's inner dialog looks.  

Conversation, both internal and external, is key to our decision making, where we reason out a best decision given the context available.  The tradional way of memorialzing our deliberations, plans and decisions are through documentation.

Dcuments are modified over time as the further conversations and decisions are made.  This approach is a human evolved approach as complete conversation recording between people is either impossible, imrpactical, underabile or inconsistent.

In an ecosystem where those conversations happen largely or in part between people and LLMs, or in combination teams of humans and LLMs, those restrictions break down and allow for a wholistic new view of the process of discussing, decing and memorializing.   If the conversation happens entirely within a chat, or a recoded digital medium, all the aspects of the conversation can be recorded in their entirety.  

If we view context as a much larger thing than the context widow of a given GPT, but instead more as humans view context through the lense of long memory, this takes on a new shape.  This becomes more insteresting if you consider the possiblities of digital storage which effecively provides an infinite conversational memory.  Thefore conversation, or the memory of a convesation is something that is not limited by a context window.  Context window is then really best seen a limitation of a given GPT or person with which can be used to derive decions making, "How much can I keep in my head to make the next right decision correctly."  

Neural nets of course have a close approximation to human brains. GPTs and human brains are largely sofisticated guessing machines with which we can apply the concepts of context and attention similarly to both.  In this sense we can rephrase the prior sentence to, "How much can I keep in my context to make the next right guess."

We largely treat LLM context as a sloppy collection of very relevant and very irrelivent tokens.  If for example you are working on coding, the LLM may consume a great deal of context window on the text of the code being generated.  This is unfortunate because the text of that code, once written to a module, may be largely irrelevnat to the next right guess (decision).   As such we waste our LLM context windows.  

There are novel approaches to this problem such as Anthropic's compaction function.  It takes a filled context window and shrinks it through summary, providing the appearance of an infinite conversation that maintains its context.  By any complex coding task reveals the limits of this approach because the compacted summaries often miss the stuff you need.  You can augment this coversatin management methodology with MCP servers such as Enhanced-Memory.  This provides you a better recall of summarized data, but again, the summary is written to Enhanced-Memory's database and the details are lost.  This is the inherent problem of recorded auto summaries in that they assume the relevance and content for the the consumers future needs, wich is very often incorrect.  

Many of these sort of summary memory approaches allow the user to chose when these summaries and made and what they should contain, but this presupposes another problem which is that the user often does not know, at the moment of summary, what they will need to know in the future.  

Human memory of course does not work this way at all.  We dynamically contruct our context on an as needed basis from the entirety of or memory.  We never presuppose what we may need to know when we learn it.  We just rember events within the given bounds and conditions at the time of our experience.   

Unfortunately our brains cannot handle photographic memory of every detail of every event, and so our brains take advantage of a framing methodololgy that builds frames through experience.  For example, you may not really be able to remember having a cake on your 10th birthday, but you prerry sure you had one, because in your framed expiernce of early birthday parties, people usually have cake.  

We could attempt summary more on this basis, to keep recent memories largely in tact, but to summarize them in frames as they move backward in time.  However, with near infinite digital storage we can take a hyrid approach towards memory as it relates to conversation, and therefor thought and decision making that can achieve far better.  

As such, we need to see context windows not as a contraint on coveration to be worked around, but rather a system limitation of people and GPTs that determines the quantity of relevant token with which we get to make the next guess.  

The concept of GPT attention is critical here. A GPT cannot affective and efficiently form attention if the context is filled with irrelevant tokens.  Context is therefore best formed through an itteligent and dynamic approach focussed on the moment in a conversation that it is most current.  

Prompts are additions to the front side of context.  A great deal of thought is placed on prompt engineering which distracts us from what is actaully key, *which is context engineering*. 

Engineers reading this thread may think, "Brilliant!  I need to write a rules engine that builds efficient context!", but this would be old thinking that ignores how human brains work.  Our brains are not rigid deterministic rules engines, they are guessing machines that learn.  In effect, the way to establish dynamic context as a brain does, should be seen as a guessing machine guessing about context for another guessing machine. And then learning how best to build context.  

With digital storage, conversational memory can be infinte and perfect.  Queries can be used to retrieve relevant details, wich can be use to produce summaries that could be used to build optimzed context in concert with recent context. 

In that context, an LLM (GPT) recieves an optmized context within the allowed window. This context is generated by a specialized GPT, an SPT (other names exist), which specializes in context generation.  Optimized context is buildt using recent relevant context (short term memory) combined with long term context derived from queries of infinite conversational history (long term memory), summarized at the granularity level required for the context.

Imagine a software coding conversation where the user suddenly recalls that work the did 3 month ago is relevant to the chat they are having presently.  The coder chats, "Hey, what was that module we were working on in June for that messaging service?"  The chat tool now has the ability to seek it out and reply, "You mean the Fogger module we built for ACME?" "Yeah, that one. I think there was a class related to Rabbit we can user here." "Yes there was. Do you want to see the code?"

The chat window is handled as a rolling window where the old parts of the conversation roll of the back relative to the performance requirements of the UI.  

This approach becomes transformative as your topics increase in complexity.  A discussion of architecture, is particularly illustrative.  With most current approaches the context windows get filled with the act of generating documentation and writing it.  This documentation is actually not helpful to your context because its a deriavtive work of the conversation. A group of experts sitting around discussing architecture don't have photographic recall of their documents, rather they look them up when they need them.  Once the SPT develops an understanding of an architectual concept, it gets better at creating context filled with relevant memories and currnet content, with the ability to recall any relevant details at the point of relevance.  SPTs are therefore domain relevant nerural networks trained on domain relevant content to ensure optimal focus and minimal model size for the rapid response needed for interconversational usage while minimizing the overhead of constant training. 

Optimal prompt generation will rely on  a number of underlying technologies and processes

Content Classification - The contents of conversations will have a classification process consising of known pattern recogniztion (eg code vs prose vs documentation) and learning models.  It may be more appriated to use classification models such as decision trees, random forests or CNNs.  Or ideally, this would be a funtion of the SPT because domain relevance should be part of the classification system.  Either way, the classification process would use a lerning model so it would improve over time.  Content will be labled with its type (document, code, LLMc response, user input, etc) and a value rating as it relates to prompt usage.   Low value content would include commands or system information, medium would include prose that is largely out of domain, documentation, or genetated code, or internal LLM delibiberation. High value content would include user inputs, and LLMs primary conversation and highly domain relevant matter, boosted content would be content specifically tied to the prompt.   

Content Storage - Every component of conversations would be stored in a data lake with appropriate metadata including the classification information.

Content Retrieval - When a prompt is required, content will be retrieved from storage to form an ideal prompt.  

Query Generation - Query generation will be one of the primary learned functions for the SPT.  The input that triggered the prompt would form the bulk of the query.  Recent content from the same conversation and content with high revelvance score will be prioritzed.

Context Generation Process - 

1. An input prompt triggers the need for context.

2. The existing conversation will fill the draft draft context in in reverse cronoligical order so that newer content makes it into the context, leaving out all low relavance content until the estimated token count reaches 75% (adjustable) of the max context window.   Each piece of content will recieve an attention score that is the combination of its temporal and context relevance along with prompt relevance boosting.  

3. A query will be formed that will retrieve content from the data lake.  The query will take the following into account:
   
   1. Relevance to the prompt
   
   2. The contents relavance score, excluding low relevance content. 
   
   3. Temporal requiredments from the prompt ("that thing from last week") will be included in the query.

4. Each retrived record from the query will be summarized and scored for attention. The level of summary will depend on the requirements as descrinbed in the prompt.

5. Retrieved content will be interleaved into the draft context by attetention score, with the lower attention items dropping out of the context in order to maintain the 75% estimated context window.   



So how do you pretrain the SPTs?  First you would of course train them on domain specific data which could include publically avaiable documents, copyrighted works for which you have the rights to, and interoganizatinal data. 

But that does not cover the ability to generate efficient context in light of infinite memory stores and recent conversation.  For this we would turn to the realm of LLMs.  A professor once said, "All LLMs halucenate, its just that sometimes they're right."  This is of course the problem of using LLMs to train other models.  You can multply the effects of halucinization.  But this of course fails to note that humans are often wrong and if you trained yourself you would make your wrongness more wrong.  We solve this problem through communicty conversation.  At work we get together with colleagues and experts.  At school we with team with classmates and teachers.  The same should apply to teaming LLMs.

LLM Teaming is key to the training process.  A set of different LLMs will form a team to judge and generate content for the training process.  Their judgment function will use a voting system.  For example, the LLM team may be asked wether the reponse to a prompt was correcty returned.  Since an LLM may halucinate, aligned voting would be used for the resulting judgement, with a hyperparameter set of the threshold of vote alignment.

There would be two phases to pretraining this model.

Phase 1

1. Train the SPT on domain specific data which could include publically avaiable documents, copyrighted works for which you have the rights to, and interoganizatinal data.

Phase 2

1) A training dataset would be built from the afformented domain specific data. 
   
   1) Random chunks of domain specific information would be exposed to the LLM team.  Perhaps paragraphs from authoritative texts. Or passages of laws or regulations.  Chapter of generally accepted practices. Etc
   
   2) Each LLM would be asked to generate a preset number of sample prompt and sample response pairs based on the exposed content.  
   
   3) Each sample prompt and sample response pair would be reviewed by the LLM team through voting on whether it is a good pair, based on their understanding of language and the contents of the exposed data.
   
   4) Sample prompt and response pairs that pass muster will be added to the test data set.
   
   5) This process will be repeated as often as is necessary for the SPT to have sufficient sample data to achieve acceptable outputs.

2) The SPT would be fed the sample prompt. 

3) The SPT would generate mutlipe candidate contexts based on the Context Generation Process above, varing the queary inputs, relevance scores and max estimated context size.

4) The candidate contexts along with their utilized query and relevance parameters would be recorded along with the hyperparameter thresholds and the sample prompt and sample response.

5) Each candidate context would be fed to each member of the LLM team.  Which would generate a candidate response.

6) The candidate responses would be reviewed for accuracy to the the sample response generating a quality rating for the candidate prompt with an explaination.  

7) The LLMs team members qaulity rating and explanation would then be voted on by the LLM team to eliminate halucinations.

8) The resultant quality rating and explaination would be recoreded along side the sample context as mentioned above.

9) The result data would be used to train and tune the model, thus the SPT becomes better at generating the correct domain specific context through adjusting its revance ratings and queary parameters, while attempting to maintain a smaller context window for cost and speed.  

In production, as prompts are generated and the SPT generates context the same trainng protocol above can be utilized to train the model using live data instead of training data.  As this LLM teaming processess will be expensive, training tests will periodically be perfomred to ensure the model is in tune.
