# Stable Relay Removal - 2025-10-03

## Summary

Stable Relay was an intermediary WebSocket relay that was **no longer needed** after building the MCP Relay. The MCP Relay connects directly to backends, making Stable Relay redundant.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Code Archived
- **From:** `/mnt/projects/ICCM/stable-relay/`
- **To:** `/mnt/projects/General Tools and Docs/archive/stable-relay_archived_2025-10-03/`
- **Contents:** relay.py, config.yaml, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, documentation

### 2. MCP Relay Extracted and Relocated
- **From:** `/mnt/projects/ICCM/stable-relay/mcp_relay.py`
- **To:** `/mnt/projects/ICCM/mcp-relay/mcp_relay.py`
- **Updated paths:** Shebang, default config path, argparser default

### 3. Documentation Archived
Moved to `/mnt/projects/General Tools and Docs/archive/`:
- `STABLE_RELAY_DEPLOYMENT_2025-10-02.md` - Original deployment doc
- `POST_RESTART_TEST_stable-relay_2025-10-02.md` - Old test procedures
- `CONTAINERIZED_CLAUDE_DESIGN_stable-relay_2025-10-02.md` - Old design doc
- `RESTART_STATUS_stable-relay_2025-10-02.md` - Historical status
- `fiedler_consultation_bug_stable-relay_2025-10-03.md` - Bug consultation
- `fiedler_consultation_with_configs_stable-relay_2025-10-03.md` - Config consultation

### 4. Documentation Updated
- ✅ `CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` - Complete rewrite, no Stable Relay
- ✅ `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Complete rewrite, only historical mentions
- ✅ `BUG_TRACKING.md` - Updated with BUG #3 resolution
- ✅ `General Architecture.PNG` - User updated, no Stable Relay shown
- ✅ `mcp_relay.py` - Updated comments and paths

### 5. Configuration Updated
- ✅ `~/.claude.json` - Changed path to `/mnt/projects/ICCM/mcp-relay/mcp_relay.py`

### 6. Remaining References
All remaining "Stable Relay" mentions are **appropriate historical context**:
- CURRENT_STATUS.md: "Archived old stable-relay code", "Removed unnecessary Stable Relay layer"
- BUG_TRACKING.md: "Initial attempt used unnecessary Stable Relay intermediary"
- Fiedler output files: Historical troubleshooting sessions (noted in README)

## New Architecture

**Before (with Stable Relay):**
```
Claude Code → MCP Relay → Stable Relay (8000) → KGB (9000) → Fiedler/Dewey
```

**After (direct connections):**
```
Claude Code → MCP Relay → Direct WebSocket
                  ├→ ws://localhost:9010 (Fiedler)
                  └→ ws://localhost:9020 (Dewey)
```

## Benefits of Removal

1. **Simpler architecture** - One less component in the chain
2. **Lower latency** - Direct WebSocket connections
3. **Easier troubleshooting** - Fewer moving parts
4. **Cleaner codebase** - Removed redundant code

## Container Status

The `stable-relay` Docker container can be stopped and removed:
```bash
docker stop stable-relay
docker rm stable-relay
```

The relay functionality is now provided by the MCP Relay subprocess within Claude Code.

**Status:** Complete - All Stable Relay code archived, documentation updated, no loose threads
