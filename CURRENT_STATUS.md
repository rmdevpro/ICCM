# ICCM Development Status
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-06 21:45 EDT

## üéØ Current State & Next Steps

### Current System Status
The ICCM ecosystem is operational, centered around the **IAE (Intelligent Agentic Engineering)** discipline producing **MAD (Multipurpose Agentic Duo)** agents. All core infrastructure services are deployed and integrated.

*   **Core Architecture:** MAD (Thinking Engine + Doing Engine) with shared Half-MAD services.
*   **Four Disciplines:** ICCM (Context), IDE (Decisions), IEE (Execution), IAE (Assembly)
*   **Communication:** All components communicate via the **MCP Relay** over WebSockets using **conversations** (not service calls).
*   **Logging:** Centralized, non-blocking logging is handled by **Godot**, which batches logs to **Dewey/PostgreSQL**. Direct Redis connections are forbidden for MCP components.
*   **Data Integrity:** Strict READ/WRITE separation is enforced between **Dewey** (READ) and **Godot** (WRITE).
*   **LLM Access:** **Fiedler** serves as the single gateway for all 10+ LLM models, providing LLM Orchestra **capability** to all MADs.
*   **Storage:** All persistent data (logs, conversations, files) is stored in PostgreSQL on a 44TB RAID array.

### Next Steps: Building Complete MADs
With the infrastructure stable and IAE Paper 00 complete, focus now shifts to implementing the first two Full MADs.

1.  **Hopper - Autonomous Development & Deployment Agent (Full MAD)**
    *   **Purpose:** Develops documents, writes code, and handles automated testing and deployment.
    *   **Status:** Planning phase.

2.  **Grace - System UI (Claude Code Replacement) (Full MAD)**
    *   **Purpose:** A modern, web-based UI for interacting with the entire ICCM ecosystem via the MCP Relay.
    *   **Status:** Planning phase.

## üöÄ Most Recent Accomplishments (2025-10-06)

### ‚úÖ Horace NAS Gateway v2.1 Deployed with PostgreSQL
*   **Milestone:** Successfully deployed Horace NAS Gateway v2.1 with triplet-approved PostgreSQL migration.
*   **Architecture:** Migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL (asyncpg with connection pooling) while maintaining full interface compatibility.
*   **Triplet Review:** Gemini authored Round 2 implementation after interface requirements feedback; GPT-4o + DeepSeek-R1 provided unanimous approval.
*   **Database:** Created `horace` database on 192.168.1.210 (irina) with proper schema permissions.
*   **Schema:** `files`, `file_versions`, `schema_version` tables with UUID primary keys and proper indexing.
*   **Integration:** Fiedler now stores all outputs to Horace shared storage (`/mnt/irina_storage/files/fiedler_output`).
*   **Benefits:** Centralized file versioning with SHA-256 checksums, system-wide file access via Horace MCP tools, full version history in PostgreSQL.
*   **Deliverable:** `/mnt/projects/ICCM/horace-nas-v2/` - Container running successfully on port 8000.

### ‚úÖ System Password Documentation Consolidated
*   **Problem:** Passwords were created across the system but never centrally documented.
*   **Solution:** Comprehensive audit of all `.env` files and docker-compose configurations across ICCM project.
*   **Documentation:** All passwords consolidated in `/mnt/projects/keys.txt` including:
    - PostgreSQL credentials (Dewey, Horace old/new, superuser)
    - System credentials (SSH, sudo)
    - API keys (Gemini, OpenAI, Together, xAI, Anthropic, GitHub, HuggingFace)
*   **Status:** GitHub Issue #17 closed.

### ‚úÖ IAE Paper 00 v1.0 Completed
*   **Milestone:** Synthesized the master IAE (Intelligent Agentic Engineering) discipline document from Council of Elders responses.
*   **Critical Clarification:** IAE is the overarching discipline (like ICCM); MAD is the architecture pattern within IAE (like CET within ICCM).
*   **Quaternary Structure Established:**
    - **ICCM** ‚Üí Context Engineering ‚Üí CET (Thinking Engine component 1)
    - **IDE** ‚Üí Decision Engineering ‚Üí Rules Engine + DER (Thinking Engine components 2-3)
    - **IEE** ‚Üí Execution Engineering ‚Üí Doing Engine
    - **IAE** ‚Üí Agent Assembly ‚Üí State Manager + Complete MAD agents
*   **Terminology Standardized:**
    - **Conversations** (not "service calls"): MAD-to-MAD communication
    - **Capabilities** (not "services"): Functions provided by Half-MADs
    - **Half-MADs**: Minimal Thinking Engine providing capabilities (Fiedler, Dewey, Godot, Marco, Horace, Gates, Playfair)
    - **Full MADs**: Complete Thinking + Doing Engines (Hopper, Grace)
*   **Deliverable:** `docs/papers/00_IAE_Intelligent_Agentic_Engineering_v1.0.md` (200 lines, foundational sections complete)

*   **Deliverable:** `docs/papers/00_IDE_Intelligent_Decision_Engineering_v1.0.md` (726 lines)

### ‚úÖ IEE Paper 00 v1.0 Placeholder Created
*   **Status:** Placeholder document establishing IEE (Intelligent Execution Engineering) as the fourth discipline.
*   **Rationale:** Full development deferred until Hopper and Grace implementations provide practical Doing Engine patterns.
*   **Deliverable:** `docs/papers/00_IEE_Intelligent_Execution_Engineering_v1.0.md` (353 lines)

### ‚úÖ WebSocket Frame Limit Increased to 200MB System-Wide
*   **Problem:** Conversation retrieval was failing with "message too big" errors (default 1MB WebSocket limit).
*   **Solution:** The `max_size` limit was increased to 200MB across the entire stack: `iccm-network` library, Godot, Dewey, and the MCP Relay.
*   **Architectural Improvement:** A reusable `MCPClient` class was created in the `iccm-network` library to ensure consistent client configuration.
*   **Status:** **FULLY VERIFIED.** Successfully retrieved a 9.6MB conversation through the full pipeline.

### ‚úÖ Claude Opus 4 Integration Completed
*   **Problem:** The Claude Opus model was failing due to a missing `anthropic` library and provider implementation.
*   **Solution:** Added the dependency, implemented the `AnthropicProvider`, rebuilt the Fiedler container.
*   **Status:** **FULLY OPERATIONAL.** Claude Opus 4 is now integrated into the Fiedler LLM gateway.

### ‚úÖ MAD Ecosystem Architecture v1.1 Approved
*   **Milestone:** Formalized the MAD architecture, resolving critical gaps in the v1.0 draft related to learning loops, decision-making (LLM Orchestra), and state management.
*   **Status:** Approved by the LLM triplet, greenlighting implementation of Hopper and Grace.

## üèõÔ∏è Critical Architecture Overview

### The IAE Discipline & MAD Architecture
**IAE (Intelligent Agentic Engineering)** is the discipline for building MAD agents through integration of four sub-disciplines:

**Quaternary Structure:**
- **ICCM** (Context Engineering) ‚Üí CET
- **IDE** (Decision Engineering) ‚Üí Rules Engine + DER
- **IEE** (Execution Engineering) ‚Üí Doing Engine
- **IAE** (Agent Assembly) ‚Üí State Manager + Complete MAD agents

A Complete MAD consists of a Thinking Engine, a Doing Engine, and shared infrastructure Half-MADs.

**Thinking Engine Components:**
1.  **CET:** Context Engineering Transformer for routing (from ICCM)
2.  **Rules Engine:** For deterministic constraints (from IDE)
3.  **LLM Orchestra:** Multi-model consultation capability via Fiedler (available to ALL components)
4.  **Decision Maker (DER):** Synthesizes inputs into a final action (from IDE)
5.  **State Manager:** Maintains World Model, Task Context, and Execution State (from IAE)

**Infrastructure Half-MADs (Deployed Services):**
*   **Fiedler:** LLM Gateway providing LLM Orchestra capability (outputs stored to Horace shared storage)
*   **Dewey:** READ-only Memory (Conversations, Logs) - PostgreSQL backend on 192.168.1.210
*   **Godot:** WRITE-only Logging and Conversation Management - PostgreSQL backend on 192.168.1.210
*   **Horace:** File Storage & Versioning capability - PostgreSQL catalog with SHA-256 versioning (NAS Gateway v2.1)
*   **Marco:** Browser Automation (Internet Gateway) capability
*   **Gates:** Document Generation (Markdown ‚Üí ODT) capability
*   **Playfair:** Diagram Rendering (DOT, Mermaid ‚Üí PNG) capability

---

## üèÜ Key Milestones & Decisions Summary

### Architectural Integrity Restored (2025-10-06)
*   **Dewey is READ-Only:** All write tools were removed from Dewey, enforcing the Option 4 architecture where Godot is the single source of truth for writes.
*   **Fiedler Logs All Conversations:** Fiedler was fixed to correctly log all LLM interactions to Godot.
*   **KGB Proxy Eliminated:** The legacy KGB proxy was fully removed from the architecture.

### Critical Decision: MCP-Based Logging is Mandatory (2025-10-05)
*   **Rule:** All MCP servers **MUST** use MCP-based logging by calling the `logger_log` tool on Godot. Direct connections to Godot's internal Redis instance are **FORBIDDEN**.
*   **Reason:** This enforces protocol separation, improves system observability, and prevents architectural violations.

### Core Infrastructure Components Deployed (2025-10-04 & 2025-10-05)
*   **Horace Deployed:** File storage gateway is operational.
*   **Godot Deployed:** Unified logging infrastructure is operational.
*   **Playfair Deployed:** Diagram generation gateway is operational and can save files to disk, resolving previous token limits.
*   **Marco Deployed:** Internet gateway for browser automation is operational.
*   **Gates Deployed:** Document generation gateway is operational.
*   **PostgreSQL Storage Migrated:** Database now resides on a 44TB RAID 5 array, enabling long-term data retention.

# CURRENT_STATUS.md Update - 2025-10-07 02:22 EDT

## üîß MCP Relay Path Issue Fixed

### Problem Found & Resolved
- **Issue**: MCP Relay had hardcoded paths pointing to `/mnt/projects/ICCM/mcp-relay/` 
- **Root Cause**: When relay was moved to local installation at `/home/aristotle9/mcp-relay/`, the hardcoded paths prevented it from finding `backends.yaml`
- **Impact**: Claude Code couldn't start relay due to immediate "Config load failed" error

### Code Changes Made
1. **Fixed hardcoded paths** in `mcp_relay.py`:
   - Line 88: Changed `__init__` default config path to use dynamic resolution
   - Line 968: Changed argparse default to use `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "backends.yaml")`
2. **Added missing import**: Added `import os` to imports (line 17)

### Verification
- Relay now starts successfully when run manually
- Loads all 7 backends correctly: marco, fiedler, dewey, horace, godot, playfair, gates
- Config file properly found at `/home/aristotle9/mcp-relay/backends.yaml`

## Infrastructure Status Update (02:22 EDT)
- MCP Relay: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Path issues resolved, ready for Claude Code restart
- Fiedler: ‚úÖ Running on 192.168.1.210:9012
- Dewey: ‚úÖ Running on 192.168.1.210:9022
- Godot: ‚úÖ Running on 192.168.1.210:9060
- Horace: ‚úÖ Running on 192.168.1.210:9070
- Marco: ‚úÖ Running on 192.168.1.210:9031
- Playfair: ‚úÖ Running on 192.168.1.210:9040
- Gates: ‚úÖ Running on 192.168.1.210:9050

## Next Immediate Action
**RESTART CLAUDE CODE** to reconnect with the fixed MCP relay and test Fiedler integration
