# MCP Relay - stdio to WebSocket Multiplexer

**Purpose:** Unified MCP server that aggregates multiple WebSocket MCP backends into a single stdio interface for Claude Code.

---

## Overview

MCP Relay solves the transport compatibility problem between Claude Code (stdio-only) and ICCM's WebSocket-based MCP servers. It acts as a multiplexer that:

1. Implements MCP protocol on stdio (Claude Code side)
2. Connects to multiple WebSocket MCP servers (backend side)
3. Aggregates tools from all backends into unified interface
4. Routes tool calls to appropriate backend
5. Auto-reconnects when backends restart

---

## Architecture

```
Claude Code
    ↓ stdio (subprocess)
MCP Relay (mcp_relay.py)
    ↓ WebSocket connections
Stable Relay (port 8000)
    ↓
KGB Proxy (port 9000)
    ├→ Fiedler (8 LLM models)
    └→ Dewey (conversation storage)
```

---

## Configuration

### Claude Code MCP Config

**File:** `~/.claude.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iccm": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/mnt/projects/ICCM/stable-relay/mcp_relay.py",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Backend Configuration

**File:** `/mnt/projects/ICCM/stable-relay/backends.yaml`

```yaml
backends:
  - name: fiedler
    url: ws://localhost:8000?upstream=fiedler

  - name: dewey
    url: ws://localhost:8000?upstream=dewey
```

---

## How It Works

### Startup Sequence

1. Claude Code spawns `mcp_relay.py` as stdio subprocess
2. MCP Relay loads backend configuration from `backends.yaml`
3. Claude sends `initialize` request via stdin
4. MCP Relay connects to all backends via WebSocket
5. MCP Relay sends `tools/list` to each backend
6. Backends return their tools
7. MCP Relay aggregates tools and builds routing table
8. MCP Relay returns unified tool list to Claude

### Tool Call Flow

1. Claude calls tool via stdio (e.g., `fiedler_send`)
2. MCP Relay looks up backend from routing table → `fiedler`
3. MCP Relay forwards request to Fiedler backend via WebSocket
4. Fiedler executes tool and returns result
5. MCP Relay forwards result back to Claude via stdout

### Backend Restart Handling

1. Backend connection lost (e.g., Fiedler container restarted)
2. MCP Relay detects disconnection
3. MCP Relay attempts reconnection every 5 seconds
4. Backend comes back online
5. MCP Relay reconnects and re-discovers tools
6. Tool calls resume normally
7. **Claude never knew anything happened**

---

## Key Benefits

### 1. Single MCP Entry
- One "iccm" server in Claude's config
- Exposes all tools from all backends
- No need to configure each backend separately

### 2. Dynamic Tool Discovery
- Edit `backends.yaml` to add/remove backends
- Tools automatically appear/disappear
- No Claude restart required

### 3. Network-Wide Access
- Connect to any WebSocket MCP server
- Can be on localhost, containers, remote machines, cloud
- URL can point anywhere: `ws://remote-server:port`

### 4. Backend Restart Resilience
- Backends can restart without affecting Claude
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- Transparent to end user

### 5. Full Logging Chain
- All traffic routes through Stable Relay → KGB
- KGB automatically logs conversations to Dewey/Winni
- Complete audit trail of all LLM interactions

└── MCP_RELAY.md          # This file
```

### Dependencies

- Python 3.12+
- `websockets` - WebSocket client/server library
- `pyyaml` - YAML configuration parsing

### MCP Protocol Implementation

The relay implements these MCP methods:

1. **initialize** - Server initialization handshake
2. **notifications/initialized** - Initialization complete notification
3. **tools/list** - Return aggregated tool list from all backends
4. **tools/call** - Route tool call to appropriate backend

### Tool Routing

Tools are routed by name prefix or routing table lookup:

```python
tool_routing = {
    "fiedler_send": "fiedler",
    "fiedler_list_models": "fiedler",
    "dewey_store_conversation": "dewey",
    "dewey_search_conversations": "dewey",
    # ... etc
}
```

## Adding New Backends

### Step 1: Add to backends.yaml

```yaml
backends:
  - name: fiedler
    url: ws://localhost:8000?upstream=fiedler
  - name: dewey
    url: ws://localhost:8000?upstream=dewey
  - name: my-new-service  # ← Add this
    url: ws://my-server:9999
```

### Step 2: Ensure Backend is Running

```bash
# Verify backend is accessible
curl -v -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" \
  -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Key: test==" \
  http://my-server:9999/
```

### Step 3: Tools Appear Automatically

- MCP Relay discovers tools on next `tools/list` request
- No code changes needed
- No Claude restart needed (if relay already running)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Check MCP Relay Logs

MCP Relay logs to stderr (Claude captures this):

```bash
# Logs appear in Claude Code's debug output
# Look for lines like:
# 2025-10-03 17:00:00,123 - INFO - Connected to fiedler: ws://localhost:8000?upstream=fiedler
# 2025-10-03 17:00:00,456 - INFO - Registered tool: fiedler_send → fiedler
```

### Test Relay Manually

```bash
# Send test request
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}},"id":1}' | \
  /mnt/projects/ICCM/stable-relay/mcp_relay.py
```

### Check Backend Connectivity

```bash
# Verify backend containers running
docker ps --filter "name=fiedler|dewey|stable-relay|kgb"

# Check backend logs
docker logs fiedler-mcp --tail 20
docker logs dewey-mcp --tail 20
```

### Common Issues

**Tools not appearing:**
- Check `backends.yaml` syntax
- Verify backend URLs are correct
- Check backend containers are running
- Look for connection errors in relay logs

**Tool calls failing:**
- Check routing table (tool name → backend mapping)
- Verify backend is responding to MCP requests
- Check WebSocket connection is still alive

**Backend won't reconnect:**
- Check backend URL hasn't changed
- Verify network connectivity
- Look for reconnection attempts in logs
- Check reconnect delay (default 5 seconds)

---

## Performance Characteristics

- **Startup time:** ~100ms per backend (parallel connection)
- **Tool call latency:** +10-20ms overhead (stdio ↔ WebSocket translation)
- **Memory usage:** ~30MB base + ~5MB per backend
- **Connection limit:** Theoretically unlimited, practically 10-20 backends

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Hot reload:** Watch `backends.yaml` for changes, reload without restart
2. **Connection pooling:** Reuse WebSocket connections across tool calls
3. **Caching:** Cache tool lists to reduce backend queries
4. **Metrics:** Export Prometheus metrics for monitoring
5. **Health checks:** Periodic health checks to detect backend issues
6. **Load balancing:** Distribute calls across multiple backend instances
